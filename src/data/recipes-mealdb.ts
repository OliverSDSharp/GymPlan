Gather @red pepper{1}, @beef stock{1 L}, @extra virgin olive oil{Pinch}.
Cook the meat: Place the flank steak in a #pot{} with broth or @water{2 1/2 cups} and @salt{Pinch}. Cook over low heat for about 2 hours, until tender and easy to shred.
Shred the meat: Once cooked, drain and shred the meat using two forks. Prepare the vegetables: Sauté chopped @onion{1}, bell pepper, and @garlic{2 cloves} in a little oil.
Add @cumin{1 tsp}, @oregano{1 tsp}, @paprika{1 tsp}, and salt. Stir in the meat and cook for a few minutes until the flavors are well combined. Make the dough: In a bowl, mix the cornmeal with warm water and salt until a soft dough forms.
Let it rest for 5 minutes. Form the arepas: Divide the dough into 6 portions, shape into balls, and flatten into thick discs.
Cook: Cook the arepas on a griddle or #skillet{} over medium heat for 2–3 minutes on each side until golden. You can then bake them for a few minutes if you prefer them crispier.

Gather @mixed beef cuts{2kg}.
Prepare the Fire: Start a wood fire in your #grill{} and let it burn down to coals. Season the Meat: Generously @salt{To taste} the beef cuts. Grill the Meat: Place the beef on the grill, starting with the thickest cuts farthest from the coals. Add @chorizo{4} and @morcilla{2} after the beef has been cooking for a while. Cook to Perfection: Cook the meat, turning occasionally, until it reaches your desired doneness. Typically, ribs may take up to 2 hours; thinner cuts will cook faster. Rest and Serve: Let the meat rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with chimichurri sauce and grilled vegetables. Pro Tips:
Use a mix of wood and charcoal for a consistent heat source. Wood adds flavor, while charcoal maintains temperature. Season the meat just before grilling to ensure it retains its moisture and flavor. Serving Suggestions:
Serve with a side of chimichurri sauce, a fresh tomato salad, and crusty bread. Pair with a robust Malbec wine to complement the rich flavors of the meat.`},

Gather @plain flour{2 tbs}, @red wine{200ml}, @beef stock{400ml}, @puff pastry{400g}.
Preheat the #oven{} to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Toss the @beef{1kg} and flour together in a bowl with some @salt{pinch} and black @pepper{pinch}. Heat a large casserole until hot, add half of the @rapeseed oil{2 tbs} and enough of the beef to just cover the bottom of the casserole.
Fry until browned on each side, then remove and set aside. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef. Return the beef to the pan, add the wine and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock, @onion{1 finely sliced}, @carrots{2 chopped}, @thyme{3 sprigs} and @mustard{2 tbs}, and season well with salt and pepper.
Cover with a lid and place in the #oven{} for two hours. Remove from the oven, check the seasoning and set aside to cool. Remove the thyme.
When the beef is cool and you're ready to assemble the pie, preheat the #oven{} to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Transfer the beef to a pie dish, brush the rim with the beaten @egg yolks{2 free-range} and lay the pastry over the top.

Gather @olive oil{3 tbs}, @thyme{1 tbs chopped}, @bay leaf{2}, @beef stock{400ml}, @corn flour{2 tbs}, @plain flour{400g}, @eggs{To Glaze}.
Season the @beef{900g} cubes with @salt{pinch} and black pepper. Heat a tablespoon of oil in the #skillet{} and fry the meat over a high heat.
Do this in three batches so that you don’t overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof #casserole dish{} once it is browned all over.
Add extra oil if the pan seems dry. In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the @shallots{3} for 4-5 minutes, then add the @garlic{2 cloves minced} and fry for 30 seconds.
Add the @bacon{125g} and fry until slightly browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the #casserole dish{} and add the herbs.
Preheat the #oven{} to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Pour the @stout{330ml} into the #skillet{} and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Pour the stout over the beef in the #casserole dish{} and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the #oven{} for 1½-2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced.
Skim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste. Put the #casserole dish{} on the hob – don’t forget that it will be hot – and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened.
Leave to cool. Increase the #oven{} to 200C/400F/Gas 6. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl. Grate the @butter{250g} and stir it into the flour in three batches.
Gradually add 325ml/11fl oz cold water – you may not need it all – and stir with a round-bladed knife until the mixture just comes together.
Knead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g/9oz for the pie lid. Roll the rest of the pastry out until about 2cm/¾in larger than the dish you’re using.
Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the @oysters{8} in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg.
Roll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife.
Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a #baking tray{} and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling.`},

Gather @garlic clove{3}, @carrots{3 oz}, @ground beef{1 lb}.
Add'l ingredients: mayonnaise, siracha
1
Place @rice{White} in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse until water runs clear. Add to a small #pot{} with 1 cup water (2 cups for 4 servings) and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15 minutes. Keep covered off heat for at least 10 minutes or until ready to serve.
2
Meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. Peel and finely chop garlic. Zest and quarter @lime{1} (for 4 servings, zest 1 lime and quarter both). Trim and halve @cucumber{1} lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into half-moons. Halve, peel, and medium dice @onion{1}. Trim, peel, and grate carrot.
3
In a medium bowl, combine cucumber, juice from half the lime, ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, a pinch of garlic, a squeeze of lime juice, and as much sriracha as you’d like. Season with salt and pepper.
4
Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. Add beef, remaining garlic, and 2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for 4 servings). Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until beef is browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes. Stir in @soy sauce{2 oz}. Turn off heat; taste and season with salt and pepper.

Gather @beef shin{600g}, @challots{350g}, @chestnut mushroom{250g}, @garlic clove{2 sliced}, @tomato puree{1 tbs}, @red wine{750 ml}, @bay leaf{2}.
Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp @goose fat{3 tsp}. Season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary.
Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. In the same pan, fry the @bacon{100g}, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms, garlic and @bouquet garni{1} until lightly browned.
Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew.
Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. Pour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered.
Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour.
Heat #oven{} to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil.
Then cook for 3 hrs. If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan.
To make the @celeriac{600g} mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat the @olive oil{2 tbs} in a large #skillet{}. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden.
Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the @rosemary{sprigs of fresh}, @thyme{sprigs of fresh}, bay and @cardamom{4} pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac.
Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins. After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated.
Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste.
Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.`},

Gather @beef brisket{4-5 pound}, @onion{3}.
1 Prepare the brisket for cooking: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely. Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern. @salt{Dash} the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.   2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an #oven{}-proof, thick-bottomed #pot{} with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions. Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.) Turn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.
3 Sauté the onions and @garlic{5 cloves}: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the #pot{} and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil. Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Sauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.   4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in #oven{}: Preheat the oven to 300°F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the @bay leaves{4}, @rosemary{1 sprig} and @thyme{1 Sprig}. Move the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the @beef stock{2 cups} and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, place the pot in the 300°F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.   5 Add @carrots{3 Large}, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender. 6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs. 7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step. To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a #blender{}, and purée until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of @mustard{1 Tbsp} to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm. 8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. Serve with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled @potatoes{4 Mashed}, egg noodles or polenta.`},

Gather @english mustard{1-2tbsp}, @flour{Dusting}, @egg yolks{2 Beaten}.
Put the @mushrooms{400g} into a #blender{} with some seasoning and pulse to a rough paste. Scrape the paste into a pan and cook over a high heat for about 10 mins, tossing frequently, to cook out the moisture from the mushrooms.
Spread out on a plate to cool. Heat in a #skillet{} and add a little @olive oil{Dash}. Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 secs only on each side. (You don't want to cook it at this stage, just colour it).

With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared @beef fillet{750g piece} in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape.
Twist the ends of the cling film to secure. Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and keep its shape. Roll out the @puff pastry{500g} on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a £1 coin.
Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess.

For the brioche buns heat the @milk{80g} with the @butter{60g} and @molasses{1 tablespoon} until the butter has melted. Add the cold @water{220g} and @egg{9} to this mix.
2 In a large bowl place flour, @salt{10g} and @yeast{10g} and mix. Then add the milk and water mix and stir with a wooden spoon until combined. You don't have to knead the dough, it is perfectly fine to do this by hand with a wooden spoon, this doesn't need to be very thorough. Cover with a damp towel and stick in the fridge overnight.
3 The next morning knead dough on a generously floured surface for a little and cut into eight equal pieces. Shape these into balls and place on a #baking tray{} lined with parchment paper. Cover again with damp towel and let rise for about an hour or until double in size.
4 Heat #oven{} to 220 degrees Celsius. Brush the buns with either milk, heavy cream or @egg wash{Splash} and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if desired. Bake for about 15-20min or until golden. Let cool.
5 For the toppings chop the onions and sauté in a bit of butter, let caramelize, this may take ten to 15 minutes, stir occasionally. Rub the steaks with a bit of @garlic{To serve} and then #grill{} or fry the steaks, the @bacon{8}, and eggs with salt and pepper, toast the buns after having cut in half. Spread @mustard{To serve} on one bun half, layer each chivito with steak, a slice of @ham{8 slices}, a slice of cheese, one bacon stripe, a @tomato{4} slice, and some @lettuce{1/4}.

Heat oil on medium-high heat in a large sauté pan or #skillet{}, then sauté the @onion{1 chopped} and @garlic{2 cloves minced} until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add the @ground beef{1 lb}, pork, and spices and cook until the meat is browned. Add the beef broth and bring it up to a simmer then reduce heat to medium low.
Add the grated potato and stir it in. Cook until liquid is almost absorbed, about 15 min. Remove the bay leaves and add @salt{To taste} to taste.
Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool completely — it bakes best if the filling is chilled. Preheat the #oven{} to 375 °F (190 °C).
On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of the pie dough to less than the 1/4-inch thickness and line the 9-inch pie plate.
Fill this with the cooled tourtière mixture and spread out evenly. Roll out the remaining dough to the same thickness, cut a hole in the centre (for steam to escape) and place on top of the filling.
Trim the dough to 1/2-inch beyond the edge of the pie plate and pinch the edges of the crust together. Brush the crust with the @egg{1 beaten} wash.
Bake tourtière for about 45 minutes or until the pastry is a rich golden brown. Let cool for 15 minutes before slicing to serve.

If you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take one of the large pieces and roll it out into a very large circle. Take a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches) and cut out three circles.
Place about 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling onto 1/2 of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal.
Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined #baking tray{} and continue to work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties. Second Method: If you had pre-cut the dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time. Roll it out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger. Don’t worry if the edges are not perfect.
Place 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal.
Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined #baking tray{} and continue work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties.
Frying and Serving the Patties
After forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the #oven{} to 350 F. Just before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush the patties with egg wash. Bake patties for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Serve warm.`},

Gather @yellow split peas{1 cup}, @turnips{1 large}, @black pepper{To taste}.
The night before, break salt @beef{2 Lbs} into big chunks and soak in water overnight, at least 8-10 hours. Put split peas into a bowl and cover with water to soak overnight.
Drain the salt beef and place it into a large stockpot. Cover with fresh water, at least 6-7 litres. Place the split peas into a pease pudding canvas bag or triple layer of cheesecloth and tie, making sure to leave room for peas to expand inside the bag.
Put the bag inside the #pot{}, tying the strings to the outside handle so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot with the salt beef.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 2 hours. Remove the peas pudding bag and empty contents into a bowl, mixing with @butter{3  tablespoons} and pepper for taste.
Set aside. Add your @cabbage{1 head} to the #pot{} and boil for 20 more minutes. Then add turnip, @carrots{6} and @potatoes{8} then boil for 20 more, or until vegetables are tender.

To make the sauce, put all the ingredients into a #blender{} with 1 tbsp water and whizz until as smooth as possible. This will make more than you’ll need for the recipe but will keep for a week in an airtight jar.
Heat a griddle or #skillet{} to high. Brush away the garlic and parsley stalks from the steaks and season well. Sear the steaks for 2 minutes on each side then rest on a plate. Put the @ciabatta{2} halves onto the plate, toasted-side down, to soak up any juices.

Gather @carrots{1 large}, @spring onions{2 chopped}, @thyme{4 sprigs}, @onion{1 Diced}, @black pepper{1/2 tsp}, @red pepper{2 chopped}, @garlic clove{4 Mashed}, @allspice{1 tbs}, @beef{2 Lbs}, @plain flour{1 cup}.
Wash and rinse the dried @kidney beans{2 cups}.. then cover with @@water{1/4 cup}{2L} in a deep bowl. Remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job.
Have your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep #pot{} with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in.
Time to start the soup. Place everything in the #pot{} (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart.
It’s now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the @coconut milk{1 cup} and continue cooking for 15 minutes.
Now is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape.
Add them to the #pot{}, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil.
You’ll notice that I didn’t add any salt to the #pot{} as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish. However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused. Cook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the @potatoes{4} and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools.
While this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.`},

Gather @ground beef{1}, @vegetable oil{1 tsp}.
1. Preheat #oven{} to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice @potatoes{5} into 1/2-inch pieces. Trim, peel, and cut @carrots{12 ounces} on a diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice @scallions{1}, separating whites from greens; finely chop whites. Peel and finely chop @garlic{2 cloves}.
2. In a medium bowl, soak @bread{1 Slice} with 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings); break up with your hands until pasty. Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the garlic, salt (we used 3/4 tsp kosher salt; 11/2 tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for 4). Place on one side of a #baking tray{}. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, spread meatloaves out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes (we'll glaze the meatloaves then).
3. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a medium #pot{} with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until very tender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain. While potatoes cook, in a small bowl, combine @soy sauce{2}, @garlic powder{1}, 1/4 cup ketchup (1/2 cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp @sugar{2 tsp} (4 tsp for 4).
4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from #oven{}. Spoon half the ketchup glaze over meatloaves (save the rest for serving); return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves are cooked through, and glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more.
5. Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP @butter{2 tbsp} (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in #pot{} used for potatoes over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potatoes and 1/4 tsp wasabi. Mash, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (If you like things spicy, stir in more wasabi!)
6. Divide meatloaves, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots between plates. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve with remaining ketchup glaze on the side for dipping.`},

Gather @hotsauce{4 tbsp}, @cheese{250g}, @mayonnaise{2 tbsp}, @sour cream{4 tbsp}, @lettuce{4 leaves}, @red pepper{2}.
Put the @chicken breasts{2} between two pieces of baking parchment and use a rolling pin to gently bash them until they are approximately 1cm thick. Cut each chicken breast into two even pieces.
If you're using a #skillet{}, heat two frying pans over medium-high heat, with one of them containing @oil{1 tbsp}. Fry the chicken in the oiled pan for 3-4 mins on each side until they are cooked through. Season the chicken, reduce the heat, drizzle in the chilli sauce and half of the @lemon juice{½}, and cook for an additional 1-2 mins until the sauce is reduced. Remove the chicken from the heat.
If you're using an air-fryer, preheat it to 180C for 4 mins. Add the chicken to the air-fryer and cook for 12 mins. Drizzle over the chilli sauce and half the lemon juice and cook for an additional 1-2 mins until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is reduced. Remove the chicken and keep it warm. While the chicken is cooking, toast the @buns{2} in the dry #skillet{} for 30 seconds. Transfer them to a plate.

Once the onion and mushrooms are almost cooked, stir in the flour – this will make a thick paste called a roux. If you are using a stock cube, crumble the cube into the roux now and stir well. Put the roux over a low heat and stir continuously for 2 mins – this will cook the flour and stop the sauce from having a floury taste.
Take the roux off the heat. Slowly add the fresh stock, if using, or pour in 500ml water if you’ve used a stock cube, stirring all the time. Once all the liquid has been added, season with pepper, a pinch of @nutmeg{pinch} and @mustard powder{pinch}.

Gather @chicken thighs{1 lb}, @canola oil{3  tablespoons}, @onion{2/3 Cup}, @ground ginger{2 tsp}, @jasmine rice{4 cups}, @chinese five spice powder{1/2 tsp}, @sesame seed oil{1 tsp}.
Fried rice is best made with leftover rice that's at least a day old. Otherwise it becomes gummy in the #skillet{}. If you don’t have any leftover rice from the night before, cook a batch of rice and spread it on a large #baking tray{} or several large plates. Let the rice dry out for about 1 to 2 hours before using it for fried rice.
Rice sticks to the pan very easily, so make sure to use a #wok{} or pan that doesn’t have a sticky surface. I usually cook stir-fries in my seasoned carbon steel wok, but cast iron or nonstick pans work well, too. You might need to add a little more oil if things aren’t releasing easily.
Prepare the chicken: Chop the chicken into small 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of @salt{1 tsp} over the chicken and mix to combine. Set the chicken aside for about 10 minutes (I usually use this time to chop all the vegetables).
Scramble the @egg{3 Large}: Heat a #wok{} or large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Swirl in a tablespoon of oil and add the whisked eggs. Use a spatula to quickly scramble the eggs, breaking the curds into smaller pieces as they come together. Transfer the eggs to a plate.
Cook the chicken: Add another tablespoon of oil in the #wok{} or pan. Add the chicken and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and transfer the cooked chicken to a plate.
Using your spatula, scrape off any chicken bits that are still stuck to the #wok{} so they don't burn during the next step. You can also use paper towels to wipe down your wok or pan.
Cook the vegetables: Swirl 1 tablespoon of oil into the #wok{} over medium-high heat. Add the diced onions and cook them for 1 minute, until they start to soften. Mix in the minced @garlic{2 cloves minced} and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the diced @carrots{1 large} and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the @peas{2/3 Cup}, and stir to incorporate.
Cook the rice: Add the rice to the #wok{} or pan on top of the vegetables and stir to combine. Using the back of your spatula, smash any large chunks of rice to break them apart. Add the white and green parts of the sliced @scallions{2 sliced} (save the dark green parts) and five-spice powder. Stir to incorporate. If the rice starts to stick to the pan, stir in a little more oil.
Drizzle the @soy sauce{2.5 tbsp} and sesame oil over the rice and stir to incorporate. Stir in the cooked chicken, scrambled eggs, and the dark parts of the scallions. Stir briefly to bring it together, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
Serve: Taste, and add more soy sauce if necessary. Serve immediately.`},

Heat the @chicken stock{450ml} in a lidded #saucepan{}. Add the @chicken breast{3} and bring to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes.
Remove the chicken breasts from the water with tongs and place on a plate. Pour the cooking liquor into a large jug. Melt 25g/1oz of the @@butter{200g}{75g} in a large heavy-based #saucepan{} over a low heat.
Stir in the leeks and fry gently for two minutes, stirring occasionally until just softened. Add the @garlic{2 cloves minced} and cook for a further minute.
Add the remaining butter and stir in the flour as soon as the butter has melted. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
Slowly pour the @milk{200ml} into the pan, just a little at a time, stirring well between each adding. Gradually add 250ml/10fl oz of the reserved stock and the wine, if using, stirring until the sauce is smooth and thickened slightly.
Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black @pepper{pinch}.
Remove from the heat and stir in the cream. Pour into a large bowl and cover the surface of the sauce with cling ilm to prevent a skin forming.
Set aside to cool. Preheat the #oven{} to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put a #baking tray{} in the oven to heat. For the pastry, put the flour and butter in a #blender{} and blend on the pulse setting until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
With the motor running, add the beaten egg and water and blend until the mixture forms a ball. Portion off 250g/10oz of pastry for the lid.
Roll the remaining pastry out on a lightly floured surface, turning the pastry frequently until around 5mm/¼in thick and 4cm/1½in larger than the pie dish.
Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and place it gently into the pie dish. Press the pastry firmly up the sides, making sure there are no air bubbles.
Leave the excess pastry overhanging the sides. Cut the chicken breasts into 3cm/1¼in pieces. Stir the chicken, @ham{150g} and leeks into the cooled sauce.
Pour the chicken filling into the pie dish. Brush the rim of the dish with beaten egg. Roll out the reserved pastry for the lid.
Cover the pie with the pastry lid and press the edges together firmly to seal. Trim any excess pastry. Make a small hole in the centre of the pie with the tip of a knife.
Glaze the top of the pie with beaten egg. Bake on the preheated tray in the centre of the #oven{} for 35-40 minutes or until the pie is golden-brown all over and the filling is piping hot.`},

Take a large #pot{} or #wok{}, big enough to cook all the @chicken{1.2 kg}, and heat the oil in it. Once the oil is hot, add sliced @onion{5 thinly sliced} and fry them until deep golden brown.
Then take them out on a plate and set aside. To the same #pot{}, add the chopped @garlic{8 cloves chopped} and sauté for a minute. Then add the chopped @tomatoes{2 finely chopped} and cook until tomatoes turn soft.
This would take about 5 minutes. Then return the fried onion to the #pot{} and stir. Add @ginger paste{1 tbsp} and sauté well. Now add the @cumin seeds{2 tsp}, half of the @coriander seeds{3 tsp} and chopped green chillies.
Give them a quick stir. Next goes in the spices – @turmeric powder{1 tsp} and red @chilli powder{1 tsp}. Sauté the spices well for couple of minutes.
Add the chicken pieces to the #wok{}, season it with @salt{To taste} to taste and cook the chicken covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through.
This would take about 15 minutes. Slowly sautéing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat.
When the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten @yogurt{1 cup} keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesn’t split.
Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried @fenugreek{3 tsp Dried} leaves. Mix well. Finally add the @cream{¾ cup} and give a final mix to combine everything well.
Sprinkle the remaining kasuri methi and @garam masala{1 tsp} and serve the chicken handi hot with naan or rotis. Enjoy!`},

Close the bag and mix thoroughly. Place in fridge for 10-12 hours (shorter is fine but longer is better). 3 Once ready to cook, heat your fry pan to medium-high and add a tiny bit of olive oil.
Fry one side of all of your flatbreads until slightly toasty. Remove from pan, add enough oil to coat the fry pan. Put crumble fries into air fryer on 180 for 15 minutes shaking occasionally. 4 The pan should be pretty hot by now, add the chicken in 2 batches (unless you have a big fry pan) to avoid overcrowding.
The chicken should get a nice sear and darker colour which is perfect. Cook for a further 5-8 minutes or until cooked through.
Repeat with next chicken batch. 5 While chicken is cooking, place your Greek yoghurt into a bowl. Combine garlic, finely chopped mint and parsley, squeeze or so of lemon and cumin.
Combine and add salt to taste. In a small bowl, combine 1tsp garlic powder, paprika, cumin, onion powder, oregano, dried parsley, cayenne pepper (optional) mix and leave aside for fries. 6 Season fries immediately once cooked and add salt to taste.
Once the chicken is complete, serve immediately by laying out your flatbread, spreading the sauce evenly over the bread, add lettuce, onion, tomato, fries, chicken, feta and more sauce on top.
Serve immediately.`},

Make the @orange{Zest of 1} sauce: Whisk together sauce ingredients in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Prep the chicken: Cut chicken into about 1-inch cubes. Whisk eggs with @salt{1 tsp} and @black pepper{1/4 tsp} in a bowl and add chicken. Stir together.
In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and @@cornstarch{1/2 cup}{1 tablespoon}. Remove chicken from eggs with a slotted spoon or tongs, letting excess @egg{2 large} drain off, then transfer to cornstarch mixture and coat well.
Fry the chicken: Add oil to a large 10- to 12-inch #skillet{}. Heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F. If you don’t have a thermometer, you can also test the temperature by sprinkling in some flour. If the oil is hot enough, it should fizzle immediately.
Once oil is hot, fry the chicken in two batches. The oil might not completely cover the chicken—that’s okay. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the chicken pieces and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 3 to 4 more minutes. Total cook time is about 6 to 8 minutes.
Remove fried chicken cubes and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, so the chicken can drain. Repeat until all the chicken is cooked.
Simmer the chicken in the sauce: Once chicken is done, pour out hot oil and wipe pan clean. Add a fresh tablespoon of oil along with chopped @garlic{2 cloves chopped} and shallot. Cook for a minute and then add the sauce. Simmer the sauce until it starts to thicken.
Once the sauce is lightly bubbling, add fried chicken and toss together to coat. The sauce should continue to thicken and stick to the chicken. Let simmer for a minute or two more. Serve orange chicken over cooked white @rice{To serve}, garnished with sesame seeds and fresh @scallions{Sliced}.
Did you love this recipe? Let us know with a rating and review!
LEFTOVERS! The orange chicken keeps well in the fridge for 5 days. Reheat in a #skillet{} with a splash of @water{1/4 cup} over low heat. Freeze the orange chicken for up to 3 months, but be sure to thaw it before reheating so the chicken doesn’t clump together.`},

Instructions   Add @chicken thighs{2 Lbs}, @all-purpose seasoning{1 tsp}, 1 tablespoon of @curry powder{2 1/2 Tbs}, @onion{1 chopped}, green onions, @green @pepper{To taste}{1/2}, @garlic{4 Cloves Chopped} cloves, @scotch bonnet{1 chopped} pepper (if using), and @thyme{3 sprigs} to a large bowl and combine, making sure all chicken pieces are covered with the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. One the chicken is done marinating, remove onions, peppers, and garlic cloves from chicken and set aside.

Gather @spring onions{1  bunch}, @ginger{1 tbs chopped}, @garlic{3 cloves}, @onion{1/2}, @red chilli{3 chopped}, @thyme{1/2 teaspoon}, @soy sauce{2 tbs}, @vegetable oil{2 tbs}, @allspice{1 tbs}, @basmati rice{200g}, @coconut milk{400g}, @spring onions{1  bunch}, @thyme{2 sprigs}, @garlic{2 cloves chopped}, @allspice{1 tbs}.
To make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a #blender{} along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a purée. If you’re having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up – don’t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.
Taste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more @brown sugar{3 tbs} until the mixture tastes well balanced.
Make a few slashes in the @chicken thighs{12} and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.
If you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you’re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins. To cook in the #oven{}, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the @@lime{Juice of 1}{1/2} halves and cook for 45 mins until tender and cooked through.
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large #saucepan{} with all the remaining ingredients except the @kidney beans{800g}. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 mins.
Add the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.`},

First, make the curry paste.

Transfer the chicken to a bowl again, leaving the sauce in the pan, and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove the yolks from the eggs and roughly chop the whites. Mash the @egg{2} yolks in a small bowl and gradually mix in a couple of tbsp of the sauce. Bring the remaining sauce to the boil to reduce a bit (you want it to just coat the chicken), then turn the heat down. Remove the bay and @cinnamon stick{1}.

Put the chicken back in the pan and heat it for about 3 mins, spooning the sauce over it. Season to taste.
Scatter over the extra parsley, the almonds pieces and the chopped egg whites (if you’re going to use them). You can serve this straight from the dish with some rice, if you like.`},

Gather @chicken thighs{1 kg}, @coriander{1 tbs}, @cumin{1 tbs}, @cardamom{1 tbs}, @cayenne pepper{1 tsp}, @paprika{2 tsp}, @lemon juice{2 tbs}, @olive oil{3 tbs}, @greek yogurt{1 cup}, @garlic clove{1}, @cumin{1 tsp}, @lemon juice{Splash}, @pita bread{6}.
Combine the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag (or bowl). Add the chicken and use your hands to make sure each piece is coated.
If using a ziplock bag, I find it convenient to close the bag then massage the bag to disperse the rub all over each chicken piece.
Marinate overnight or up to 24 hours. Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix. Cover and put in the fridge until required (it will last for 3 days in the fridge).
Heat #grill{}/BBQ (or large heavy based pan on stove) on medium high. You should not need to oil it because the marinade has oil in it and also thigh fillets have fat.
But if you are worried then oil your hotplate/#grill{}. (See notes for baking) Place chicken on the grill and cook the first side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely charred, then turn and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes (the 2nd side takes less time).
Remove chicken from the #grill{} and cover loosely with foil. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes. TO SERVE Slice chicken and pile onto platter alongside flatbreads, Salad and the Yoghurt Sauce.
To make a wrap, get a piece of flatbread and smear with Yoghurt Sauce. Top with a bit of @lettuce{Sliced} and @tomato{Sliced} and Chicken Shawarma.
Roll up and enjoy!`},

Gather @chicken thighs{1 lb}, @white vinegar{1/4 cup}, @tomato ketchup{1/4 cup}, @red pepper{1 chopped}, @yellow pepper{1 chopped}.
Coat the chicken with @egg white{1 large}: In a bowl, combine the chicken with the egg white, 1/2 teaspoon @kosher salt{1 tsp}, and @cornstarch{2 tsp}. Stir to coat the chicken evenly. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.
Make the sweet and sour sauce: Whisk together the @pineapple juice{1/4 cup}, vinegar, ketchup, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and @brown sugar{3  tablespoons}.
Stir-fry the chicken over high heat: Heat a large #skillet{} or #wok{} over high heat until a bead of water instantly sizzles and evaporates. Pour in 1 tablespoon of cooking @oil{4 tsp} and swirl to coat. It's important that the pan is very hot.
Add the chicken and spread the pieces out in one layer. Let the chicken fry untouched for 1 minute, until the bottoms are browned.
Flip and fry the other side for 1 minute. The chicken should still be pinkish in the middle. Dish out the chicken onto a clean plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.
Stir-fry the bell pepper and @ginger{1 tsp}: Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up before adding the bell pepper chunks and ginger. Fry for 1 minute.
Add the pineapple, sauce, and then, the chicken: Add the @pineapple chunks{10 oz} and the sweet and sour sauce. Turn up the heat to high. When the sauce is simmering, add the chicken pieces back in.
Let simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Timing depends on how thick you've cut your chicken. The best way to tell if the chicken is done is to take a piece out and cut into it. If it's pink, add another minute to the cooking.
Adjust the seasoning and serve: Taste the sauce and add more brown sugar or vinegar to suit your tastes, if you’d like.
Serve hot with steamed white or brown rice.`},

Gather @walnuts{300g}, @pecan nuts{200g}, @almonds{100g}, @ground cinnamon{2 tablespoons}, @ground cardomom{1 tablespoon}, @vanilla bean paste{1 tablespoon}, @unsalted butter{250g}, @filo pastry{500g}.
First, make the syrup. Tip the @sugar{500g} into a large #saucepan{} with 650ml water. Stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then turn up the heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 15 mins, then squeeze in a few drops of @@lemon{Zest of 1} juice{To taste} and simmer for a further 5 mins. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Meanwhile, for assembling the baklava later, melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat for 5 mins, skimming and discarding any froth that rises to the surface.
For the filling, crush all of the nuts in a pestle and mortar, or blitz in a #blender{} – you want a mixture of finely ground nuts with a few chunky pieces. Tip into a bowl, stir through the spices and set aside.
In a separate bowl, mix the @ricotta{500g} with the lemon and @orange{Zest of 1} zests and vanilla. Heat the #oven{} to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Brush the bottom of a large #baking tray{} (about 35 x 47cm) with some of the melted butter. Working with one sheet of filo at a time (covering the rest with a damp tea towel to prevent it drying out), lay the sheet out on a board so one of the short ends is facing you. Sprinkle 30g of the nut mixture evenly over the whole sheet, then spoon 1 tbsp of the ricotta mixture across the end closest to you. Fold this end over to enclose the filling, then lay a long, thin skewer next to the folded edge and roll the pastry around it to create a long roll. When it’s fully rolled up, it should be roughly the thickness of a chipolata sausage. While holding one end of the rolling pin or skewer, gently scrunch the filo roll like an accordion and carefully push it off the skewer and onto the prepared tray. Repeat with the rest of the filo and fillings – you should get about 12 rolls. Cut each roll into four to make 48 large baklava, or eight to make 96 mini.
Brush with the remaining melted butter. Bake for 20-25 mins until evenly golden, turning the tray around halfway through. While still hot, immediately pour over 5-6 ladlefuls of the syrup. You should hear the syrup sizzle as it hits the hot baklava. Set aside to cool and absorb.
Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn’t touch the water, or in the microwave in short bursts. Drizzle this over the cooled baklava and sprinkle with the @ground pistachios{100g}.`},

Gather @caster sugar{175g}, @self-raising flour{140g}, @vanilla extract{½ tsp}, @caster sugar{175g}, @self-raising flour{140g}, @vanilla extract{½ tsp}.
Heat #oven{} to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment (the easiest way is to cross 2 x 20cm-long strips over the base).
To make the almond sponge, put the @@butter{175g}{175g}, sugar, flour, ground @@almonds{50g}{50g}, @@baking powder{½ tsp}{½ tsp}, @@eggs{3 Medium}{3 Medium}, vanilla and @@almond extract{¼ teaspoon}{¼ teaspoon} in a large bowl.
Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean.
Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge. For the pink sponge, line the tin as above.
Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some @pink food colouring{½ tsp}. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before.
Cool. To assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge.
Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height.
Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake. Take 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length.
Roll out one @marzipan{1kg} block on a surface lightly dusted with @icing sugar{Dusting} to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick.
Brush with @apricot{200g} jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end.
Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect.
Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes. Carefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side.
Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork).
If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork. Assemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days.
Can be frozen for up to a month.`},

Gather @hazlenuts{50g}, @plain flour{150g}, @double cream{300ml}, @yogurt{100ml}.
For the biscuits, preheat the #oven{} to 200C/180C (fan)/Gas 6 and line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Scatter the nuts over a #baking tray{} and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown.
Watch them carefully so that they don’t have a chance to burn. Remove from the #oven{}, tip onto a board and leave to cool. Put the @butter{125g} and @sugar{75g} in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy.
Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the @lemon{Grated} zest, flour and @baking powder{½ tsp}.
Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball – you may need to use your hands. Divide the biscuit dough into 24 even pieces and roll into small balls.
Place the balls the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading. Press the biscuits to flatten to around 1cm/½in thick.
Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time, for 12 minutes or until very pale golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take them out of the #oven{}, but will crisp as they cool.
Store in an airtight tin and eat within five days. For the fool, rinse the @blackberries{600g} in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt.
Put the blackberries in a non-stick #saucepan{} and sprinkle over the @@caster sugar{2 tbs}{150g}. Stir in the @lemon juice{1 tbs} and heat gently for two minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices.
Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest. Simmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy.
Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the purée as possible.
Leave the purée to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml/11fl oz of purée. Put the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl – the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream further, so don’t take it too far.
When the purée is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined.
Spoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes – or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled, so don’t over-stir it.
Scatter a few tiny @mint{Garnish with} leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries. Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits.`},

Gather @shortcrust pastry{375g}, @muscovado sugar{175g}, @raisins{100g}, @vanilla extract{1 tsp}, @single cream{4 tsp}.
Preheat the #oven{} to fan 170C/ conventional 190C/gas 5. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface so it’s slightly thinner than straight from the pack.
Then cut out 18-20 rounds with a 7.5cm fluted cutter, re-rolling the trimmings. Use the rounds to line two deep 12-hole tart tins (not muffin tins).
If you only have a regular-sized, 12-hole tart tin you will be able to make a few more slightly shallower tarts. Beat the @eggs{2 large} in a large bowl and combine with the rest of the ingredients except the @walnuts{50g}.
Tip this mixture into a pan and stir continuously for 3-4 minutes until the @butter{50g} melts, and the mixture bubbles and starts to thicken.
It should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Don’t overcook, and be sure to stir all the time as the mixture can easily burn.
Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts. Spoon the filling into the unbaked tart shells so it’s level with the pastry. Bake for 15-18 minutes until set and pale golden.
Leave in the tin to cool for a few minutes before lifting out on to a wire rack. Serve warm or cold.`},

Add @tamarind pulp{16 ounces} and 1 cup granulated @sugar{1 1/2 cups} to a bowl and mash together with a spoon or fork. Take small amounts of the tamarind and sugar mix and shape them into small balls by rolling them in your hands.
Make them the size of a marble or slightly bigger, as you like. Add the remaining sugar to a flat surface, like a plate or a sheet pan.
Roll the tamarind balls in granulated sugar until they're well-coated. You can eat the tamarind balls immediately, or you can let them set for a few hours or overnight.
Allowing them to set will give them a firmer texture and more crystallized sugar coating. Enjoy.`},

Gather @puff pastry{320g}, @dark brown soft sugar{4 tbs}, @braeburn apples{3}, @creme fraiche{100ml}.
To make the @red wine jelly{4 tbs}, put the red wine, jam sugar, star anise, clove, cinnamon stick, allspice, split vanilla pod and seeds in a medium #saucepan{}. Stir together, then heat gently to dissolve the sugar. Turn up the heat and boil for 20 mins until reduced and syrupy. Strain into a small, sterilised jam jar and leave to cool completely. Will keep in the fridge for up to 1 month.
Take the pastry out of the fridge and leave at room temperature for 10 mins, then unroll. Heat the #grill{} to high and heat the #oven{} to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Cut out 2 x 13cm circles of pastry, using a plate as a guide, and place on a non-stick #baking tray{}. Sprinkle each circle with 1 tbsp sugar and grill for 5 mins to caramelise, watching carefully so that the sugar doesn’t burn. Remove from the grill. Can be done a few hours ahead, and left, covered, out of the fridge.
Peel, quarter and core the apples, cut into 2mm-thin slices and arrange on top of the pastry. Sprinkle over the remaining sugar and pop in the #oven{} for 20-25 mins until the pastry is cooked through and golden, and the apples are softened. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Warm 3 tbsp of the red wine jelly in a small pan over a low heat with 1 tsp water to make it a little more runny, then brush over the top of the tarts.

Gather @plain flour{300g}, @cream cheese{100g}, @icing sugar{1 tbls}, @maple syrup{200ml}, @light brown soft sugar{250g}, @dark brown soft sugar{100g}, @vanilla extract{1 tsp}, @pecan nuts{400g}, @dark chocolate chips{200g}.
First, make the pastry. Tip the ingredients into a #blender{} with 1 /4 tsp salt. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Drizzle 2-3 tsp cold water into the funnel while the blade is running – the mixture should start to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly into a ball. Pat into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for at least 20 mins. Heat #oven{} to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.
Remove the pastry from the fridge and leave at room temperature for 5 mins to soften. Flour the work surface, then unwrap the pastry and roll to a circle the thickness of a £1 coin. Use the pastry to line a deep, 23cm round fluted tin – mine was about 3cm deep. Press the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no gaps. Leave 1cm pastry overhanging (save some of the pastry scraps for later). Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans. Blind-bake for 15-20 mins until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to the #oven{} for 5 mins until golden brown. Trim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the tin – a small serrated knife is best for this. If there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps.
Meanwhile, weigh the @@butter{150g}{75g}, syrup and sugars into a pan, and add 1 /4 tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 mins. Reduce #oven{} to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.
Beat the @eggs{4} in a bowl. Add the syrup mixture, vanilla and pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake on the middle shelf for 50-55 mins until set. Remove from the #oven{} and leave to cool, then chill for at least 2 hrs before serving.`},

2 Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, preheat #oven{} to 200 degrees Celsius.
3 Divide dough into two parts, put one part back in the fridge before using. Roll out second part to about 2 millimeters and cut out round cookies with 5-6 centimeters in diameter. This can be done with a cookie cutter or glass. You should get 30 cookies in total or even more, I get about 40. Bake one #baking tray{} at the time for about 8-10min. Let cookies cool.
4 For the filling look for two cookies of the same size and place about one teaspoon of @dulce de leche{400g} onto the bottom one before sandwiching together.
5 Chop semi-sweet chocolate and melt with butter and @orange{Zest of 1} zest on low heat. Dunk each sandwich cookie into the chocolate and let cool off on parchment paper before serving.`},

1. Blend all the mousse ingredients together in your #blender{} until smooth. Add the @cacao{3 tbsp} powder first and, as you blend, have all the ingredients to hand in order to adjust the ratios slightly as the size of avocados and bananas varies so much. The perfect ratio in order to avoid the dish tasting too much of either is to use equal amounts of both.
2. Taste and add a few drops of stevia if you feel you need more sweetness.
3. Fill little cups or shot glasses with the mousse, sprinkle with the cacao powder or nibs and serve.
Tip If you don’t have a frozen @banana{1} to hand you can just use a normal one and then chill the mousse before serving for a cooling dessert.`},

Gather @plain flour{250g}, @sunflower oil{1 L}, @dark chocolate{200g}, @double cream{100 ml}, @milk{100 ml}, @golden syrup{3  tablespoons}.
Boil the kettle, then measure 300ml boiling water into a jug and add the melted @butter{50g} and @@vanilla extract{1/2 teaspoon}{1/2 teaspoon}. Sift the flour and @baking powder{1 teaspoon} into a big #mixing bowl{} with a big pinch of salt. Make a well in the centre, then pour in the contents of the jug and very quickly beat into the flour with a wooden spoon until lump-free. Rest for 10-15 mins while you make the sauce.
Put all the sauce ingredients into a pan and gently melt together, stirring occasionally until you have a smooth shiny sauce. Keep warm on a low heat.
Fill a large deep #saucepan{} one-third full of oil. Cooking with hot oil can be dangerous – before you start, read up on how to deep-fry safely to avoid accidents in the kitchen. Heat until a cube of @bread{2 chopped} browns in 45 seconds to 1 min. Cover a tray with kitchen paper and mix the @caster sugar{100g} and @cinnamon{2 teaspoon} together.
Fit a star nozzle to a piping bag – 1.5-2cm wide is a good size. Fill with the rested dough, then pipe 2-3 strips directly into the pan, snipping off each dough strip with a pair of kitchen scissors. Fry until golden brown and crisp. Be very careful here – if air bubbles form in the churros they can explode, especially if the oil overheats or you use old flour. Cooking with hot oil can be dangerous – before you start, read up on how to deep-fry safely to avoid accidents in the kitchen. Keep children out of the kitchen and protect yourself by wearing long sleeves and eye protection, and keeping your face away from the pan.
Once the churros are crisp and golden brown, remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on the kitchen paper-lined tray. Carry on cooking the rest of the dough in batches, sprinkling the cooked churros with some cinnamon sugar as you go. When you’ve cooked all the churros, toss with any remaining cinnamon sugar and serve with the chocolate sauce, for dipping. To see a video of how to prepare churros, take a look at our churros ice cream sandwich recipe.`},

Gather @unsalted butter{100g}, @strong white flour{250g}, @fast action yeast{1 1/2 tsp}, @caster sugar{1 tblsp}, @unsalted butter{75g}, @caster sugar{100g}.
In a small #saucepan{} heat the butter, @milk{200ml} and @salt{1 teaspoon} until the butter is melted. Allow the mixture to cool until it is lukewarm.
In a large bowl, stir together the flours, yeast, @cardamom{1 teaspoon} and sugar until combined.
Make a well in the centre and crack in the eggs. Pour in the lukewarm milk mixture and stir everything together to form a sticky dough. You may have to use your hands as the dough becomes stiffer.
Oil the work surface with a teaspoon of @olive oil{Dash}. Turn the dough out onto the oiled surface and knead vigorously for 5–8 minutes, using a plastic scraper as needed to prise the dough from the work surface. Don’t be tempted to add @flour{250g}, as this will make the buns dry and tough. Keep kneading until the dough is considerably less sticky, smoother and more elastic.
Shape into a ball, and put into a large, greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and set aside in a warm place to prove for an hour, or until doubled in size.
Meanwhile, for the filling and topping, mix the softened butter in a bowl with half the sugar and 1 tablespoon @cinnamon{2 tbsp}. Use a fork to mix the sugar and spice into the butter until it is completely combined.
Mix the remaining sugar and cinnamon in a separate bowl and set aside.
When the dough has risen, turn out onto a floured work surface and gently roll out into a 36x24cm/14x9½in rectangle. Spread the cinnamon-sugar-butter evenly over the dough with a table or palette knife.
With the longest edge closest to you, roll the dough up into a cylinder. Cut into 12 even slices.
Place each slice onto a flattened out paper cupcake case on a #baking tray{}, or into a greased muffin tin. (Baking in a muffin tin will make your cinnamon buns taller and domed.)
Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside to prove again for 30–45 minutes, or until risen.
Preheat the #oven{} to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Brush the tops of the buns with beaten @@egg{1}{2} and dust liberally with the cinnamon sugar. Bake for 12 minutes until the buns are dark golden-brown. Enjoy warm with a cup of coffee.`},

Gather @bramley apples{2 large}, @plain flour{140g}.
Get everything for the pudding prepared. Chop the @almonds{50g} coarsely. Peel, core and chop the cooking apples. Sharpen your knife and chop the @candied peel{200g}. (You can chop the almonds and apples in a #blender{}, but the peel must be done by hand.) Grate three quarters of the @nutmeg{1 whole} (sounds a lot but it's correct).
Mix the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, @raisins{1kg}, flour, @breadcrumbs{100g}, light @muscovado sugar{100g}, @eggs{3 Large} and 2 tbsp @brandy{2 tbs} or cognac in a large bowl.
Holding the @butter{250g} in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything together. Repeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 mins – the mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir. Ask the family to stir too, and get everyone to make a wish.
Generously butter two 1.2 litre bowls and put a circle of baking parchment in the bottom of each. Pack in the pudding mixture. Cover with a double layer of baking parchment, pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (keep the paper in place with a rubber band while tying). Trim off any excess paper.
Now stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top, then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to make a double package (this makes the puddings watertight). Tie with more string, and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan. Watch our video to see how to tie up a pudding correctly.
Boil or #oven{} steam the puddings for 8 hrs, topping up with water as necessary. Remove from the pans and leave to cool overnight. When cold, discard the messy wrappings and re-wrap in new baking parchment, foil and string. Store in a cool, dry place until Christmas.
To make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar. Gradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger. Put in a small bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set. The butter will keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks.
On Christmas Day, boil or #oven{} steam for 1 hr. Unwrap and turn out. To flame, warm 3-4 tbsp brandy in a small pan, pour it over the pudding and set light to it.`},

Add 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon @@sugar{1 tablespoon}{3/4 cup}, cinnamon, egg, and 1 tablespoon orange blossom water in that order to the food processor, pulsing after each addition until mixture is evenly combined and resembles a paste.
Remove small walnut-sized portions of filling with greased hands. Roll them into small logs with thin ends. Set aside.
Preheat #oven{} to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a #baking tray{} with parchment paper.
Roll out half of the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface until very thin. Place one of the almond paste logs on the edge of the pastry, fold pastry over the filling, covering it completely, and seal the edges. Mold with your fingers into a crescent shape. Using a pastry cutter, cut around the crescent, and transfer to the prepared #baking tray{}. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
Bake in the preheated #oven{} until gazelle horns are lightly golden and baked through, about 20 minutes. They should not get too dark. Let cool slightly, about 3 minutes.

Gather @double cream{150ml}, @orange zest{1}, @lemon zest{1}, @corn flour{45g}.
Put the @milk{400ml}, cream, @cinnamon stick{1} and all the citrus zest in a #saucepan{} set over a medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the milk is just steaming but not boiling, about 3-5 mins. Remove from the heat, cover with a plate and leave to infuse for at least 30 mins.
When the cream mixture has infused, whisk the @egg yolks{7}, sugar and cornflour together in a separate bowl for 3-5 mins, or until light and pale in colour. Pour the infused milk through a sieve into the egg mixture, whisking continuously. Return the mixture to the #saucepan{}.
Put the #saucepan{} over a medium-high heat and whisk for around 10-12 mins. The mixture should start thickening to a custard-like consistency – you can tell it’s ready by dipping a wooden spoon in the mixture, then running a finger through the mixture on the back of the spoon. If the line holds, it's ready. Sieve the mixture into a jug to remove any froth.
Divide the custard between six 150ml ramekins or small terracotta dishes, then leave to cool for 1 hr at room temperature until set with a slight wobble. Chill overnight.
Just before serving, sprinkle 1 tbsp @@caster sugar{6 tablespoons}{100g} over the top of each ramekin and caramelise using a kitchen blowtorch. Alternatively, slide the ramekins under a hot #grill{} until the sugar turns golden and starts to bubble. Serve straightaway.`},

Gather @all purpose flour{2 cups}, @vegetable oil{2 tablespoons}, @pine nuts{To serve}.
Prepare the @almonds{4 cups} the day before. Bring 6 cups of @water{1 cup} to a boil. Remove from heat, and add the almonds. Let the almonds soak in water for about 5 minutes, then drain and peel. Spread the almonds on baking sheets, and bake at 200 degrees F(95 degrees C) until completely dry and toasted. This takes several hours, and needs to be prepared ahead. Be careful not to burn the nuts, as this will give a bitter taste to the filling.
Combine 1 cup @@sugar{1 cup}{1 cup} and 1 cup water in a #saucepan{}, and bring to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon @@@lemon{Zest of 1} juice{1/2 teaspoon}{1 tsp}, reduce heat to low, and let it simmer until syrupy, about 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in @@@orange blossom water{2 tablespoons}{1 tablespoon}{2 tablespoons}, and remove from heat. Set sugar syrup aside.

Mix with fingers until the dough resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually sprinkle with warm water while mixing until the dough becomes soft and pliable. Divide into 4 equal portions. Cover dough with a wet cloth, and set aside.
In a #blender{}, finely grind the almonds. Measure 3 cups of the finely ground almonds into a #mixing bowl{}, and stir together with 1 cup sugar, @baking powder{1/2 teaspoon}, @vanilla{1 tsp} powder, lemon zest, and 2 tablespoons orange flower water. Mix in three eggs one at a time, stirring constantly; mix until you get a sticky, paste-like mixture.
Sprinkle @cornstarch{Sprinkling} on the rolling surface to prevent sticking. Roll each portion of dough very thinly, 1 to 2 millimeters (1/16 inch). Cut the rolled dough into circles of about 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter each. Lightly wipe the surface of each circle with cornstarch, and fit into a tart mold, cornstarch side down to prevent sticking. Gently press the dough onto the sides and bottom of the mold, and trim extra dough from around the rim. Fill three quarters of each mold with the almond filling.
Bake on the top shelf at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the surface of the tart is golden and the dough is firm.

Gather @plain flour{350g}, @currants{200g}, @mixed peel{50g}, @muscovado sugar{100g}, @cinnamon{1 tsp}, @ginger{1 tsp}, @allspice{1 tsp}, @eggs{1 beaten}.
To make the pastry, dice the @@butter{25g}{250g} and put it in the freezer to go really hard. Tip flour into the bowl of a #blender{} with half the butter and pulse to the texture of breadcrumbs.
Pour in the @@lemon{Zest of 1}{Juice of 1/2} juice and 100ml iced water, and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times until the dough is heavily flecked with butter.
It is important that you don’t overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky. On a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm.
Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.
To make the filling, melt the butter in a large #saucepan{}. Take it off the heat and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.
To make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it’s just a little thicker than a £1 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across.
Re-roll the trimming if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3).
Flip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place on a #baking tray{}.
Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously with egg white and sprinkle with the @sugar{spinkling} (pic 4). Heat the #oven{} to 220C/200C fan/gas 8.
Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with a cup of tea.
If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.`},

Gather @egg{2 medium}, @strong white bread flour{600g}.
Pour 230ml lukewarm water into a bowl and add the @yeast{5g}. Leave to stand for 3 mins, then add the @caster sugar{200g}, eggs, flour and 1 tsp sea salt flakes. Mix together to form a dough, then knead for 10 mins in stand mixer using a dough hook (or 15 mins by hand) until the dough is elastic enough to be almost see-through when stretched. Cover and set aside to rest for 30 mins, then cut into four equal pieces. Transfer to a #baking tray{} lined with baking parchment. Leave to rest for another 30 mins.
Oil the work surface and a rolling pin with @vegetable oil{Drizzle}. Working with one portion of dough at a time, flatten it against the surface using the palm of your hand, then roll it out into a thin rectangle, about 30 x 50cm. Let it rest for 2 mins while you spread a quarter of the @lard{100g} over the top. (If you want to fill your pastry with sobrasada de Mallorca, mix 50g lard with the sobrasada, and spread this over the dough instead.) Pull one corner of the flattened dough and stretch it out as far as it will go without breaking. Repeat every 10cm or so around the dough rectangle in every direction until it reaches about 50 x 70cm.
Cut a strip from each of the shorter sides and lay these beside each other along one of the longer sides of the rectangle; this is what we call the heart of the ensaimada. From there, begin rolling the dough until you have a long pastry snake. Repeat with the remaining portions of dough.
Take the first roll of dough and stretch it until it is over a metre long. Then, roll it up into a spiral, leaving 1cm between each turn of the spiral so the dough can expand. Flatten a little and transfer to a #baking tray{} lined with baking parchment. Repeat with the remaining dough. Leave to rise in a warm place for at least 12 hrs, or ideally 24 hrs.
Heat the #oven{} to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the ensaimadas in the top third of the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Bake for 18 mins until dark golden. Leave to cool on a wire rack. To fill your ensaimada with whipped cream, slice and open, then spread over the cream and close. Dust with a generous amount of icing sugar, if you like and cut into pieces to serve.`},

For the caramel place 100 grams of @@sugar{45g}{100g} in a #skillet{} without any fat and melt on medium heat. Try not to stir with a spoon, but swirl the pan itself. Let melt until you have an amber color and sugar is fully melted. Fill the bottom of four flan containers with it. Caramel will harden immediately, so you need to be fast. My containers yield about 120 milliliters each.
2 Preheat #oven{} to 150 degrees Celsius and look for a casserole or container all your four flan containers fit into.
3 Heat @milk{350g} with 45 grams of sugar and the cut and scraped out @vanilla pod{1}. The milk does not need to boil, just needs to be heated. Take out vanilla pod after a few minutes. Meanwhile stir the @@egg{2} yolks{4} and eggs gently, try not to incorporate any air in it. Them pour milk-mix into egg-mix and again only stir very gently. Pour into prepared flan containers and place these into your casserole or container. Boil water and pour the water into the large casserole. Be sure not to touch the flan mixture. Place on middle rack in the #oven{} and let bake for about 35-40 minutes. An inserted toothpick should come out clean.
4 Let cool inside the container for an hour before transferring to the fridge. Chill overnight. The next day gently release the rim and then turn upside down on a plate. Serve with some @dulce de leche{To taste} on the side.`},

Set aside about 2 Tbsp (30 mL) for later and press the mixture into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate in the bottom and up the sides.
Bake crust for 10 minutes, it will only brown slightly. Combine the vanilla custard filling ingredients (@milk{2 1/2 cups}, granulated sugar, @cornstarch{1/4 cup}, @egg yolks{3}, @vanilla extract{1 tsp} and @salt{1/4 tsp} together) and cook on medium heat, stirring constantly, until it bubbles and thickens to the texture of pudding.
Set aside to cool while you make the meringue topping. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment or in a large bowl using an electric mixer beat the meringue ingredients (egg whites, granulated sugar, @cream of tartar{1/4 tsp}) together until it holds stiff and glossy peaks.
To assemble the pie, pour the filling into the crust and top with a thick layer of the meringue, making little spikes that will brown on top.
Sprinkle the reserved crumb over the top and place it into the preheated #oven{}. Bake until the meringue browns, around 10 minutes, making sure to watch it carefully.
Chill in the fridge and eat within a few hours of baking. This pie is best eaten the same day as the meringue will soften and liquify.`},

Position an #oven{} shelf in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to fan 160C/conventional 180C/gas 4. Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with parchment paper.
For the crust, melt the @butter{85g} in a medium pan. Stir in the biscuit crumbs and @sugar{1tbsp} so the mixture is evenly moistened. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling. For the filling, increase the #oven{} temperature to fan 200C/conventional 240C/gas 9.
In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the soft cheese at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.
With the mixer on low, gradually add the sugar, then the flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle twice.
Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding the vanilla, lemon zest and juice. Whisk in the @eggs{3 Large} and yolk, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice.
Stir the 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml/7fl oz (just over 3⁄4 of the carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest).
Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy. Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a #baking tray{}.
Pour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible. Bake for 10 minutes.
Reduce #oven{} temperature to fan 90C/conventional 110C/gas 1⁄4 and bake for 25 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble.
Turn off the #oven{} and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture.
Let cool in the #oven{} for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools. Combine the reserved soured cream with the 142ml carton, the sugar and @@lemon juice{2 tsp}{1 ½ teaspoons} for the topping.
Spread over the cheesecake right to the edges. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.
Run a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate, then slide the parchment paper out from underneath.`},

Gather @peanut cookies{175g}, @gelatine leafs{5}, @golden syrup{175g}, @double cream{275ml}, @light brown soft sugar{2 tblsp}.
Oil and line a 20cm round loose- bottomed cake tin with cling film, making it as smooth as possible. Melt the @butter{50g} in a pan.
Crush the biscuits by bashing them in a bag with a rolling pin, then stir them into the butter until very well coated. Press the mixture firmly into the base of the tin and chill.
Soak the gelatine in water while you make the filling. Tip the @ricotta{500g} into a bowl, then beat in the @peanut butter{175g} and syrup.
Ricotta has a slightly grainy texture so blitz until smooth with a stick #blender{} for a smoother texture if you prefer. Take the soaked gelatine from the water and squeeze dry.
Put it into a pan with the @milk{150ml} and heat very gently until the gelatine dissolves. Beat into the peanut mixture, then tip onto the biscuit base.
Chill until set. To freeze, leave in the tin and as soon as it is solid, cover the surface with cling film, then wrap the tin with cling film and foil.
To defrost, thaw in the fridge overnight. To serve, carefully remove from the tin. Whisk the cream with the sugar until it holds its shape, then spread on top of the cheesecake and scatter with the @peanut brittle{Crushed}.`},

Gather @caster sugar{100g}, @puff pastry{500g}.
Core the @pears{8}, then peel as neatly as possible and halve. If you like, they can be prepared up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, uncovered, so that they dry out.
Tip the sugar, @butter{100g}, @star anise{2}, @cardamom{3 Pods} and @cinnamon{1 large} into an ovenproof #skillet{}, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until bubbling.
Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour. Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 mins, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised.
Don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the @brandy{2 tbs} and let it flambé, then set the pears aside.
Heat #oven{} to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out.
When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards.
Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around. Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon’s guide).
Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 mins. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide).
Reduce #oven{} to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 15 mins more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 mins, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish.`},

Gather @unsalted butter{140g}, @clear honey{300g}, @brown sugar{100g}, @self-raising flour{375g}, @ground ginger{3 tsp}, @ground cinnamon{1 tsp}, @ground clove{1/2 teaspoon}, @ground nutmeg{1/4 tsp}, @pepper{1/4 tsp}, @egg{3 Large}, @plum jam{200g}, @double cream{225ml}, @dark chocolate{140g}, @clear honey{3  tablespoons}.
Heat #oven{} to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and line the base and sides of a deep 20cm cake tin with baking parchment. Put the honey, sugar and butter in a medium #saucepan{} and cook over a medium heat until fully melted. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Put the flour and spices in a large bowl and mix everything together.
Once the liquid ingredients have cooled, whisk in the eggs. Pour over the dry ingredients, whisking them together to form a smooth batter – be careful not to overmix as this can lead to a dry cake. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 50-55 mins or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 20 mins before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Once cooled, use a large serrated knife to slice the cake into 3 layers. Spread the jam across the 2 bottom cake layers, then reassemble the cake and set aside while you make the glaze. Put the cream, chocolate and honey in a medium pan and cook over a low-medium heat until the chocolate is melted and you have a smooth, pourable mixture. Put the cake on a wire rack set over a parchment-lined #baking tray{} and pour over the glaze, making sure to cover the entire cake. Use a fish slice to carefully transfer the cake to a serving plate and allow the glaze to set. To decorate, dust with a little edible gold powder, if you like. Uniced, this cake will keep for up to 5 days. Once iced, enjoy within 3 days – just keep in the fridge, but remove before serving and eat at room temperature.`},

Gather @all purpose flour{75g}.
For the sponge cake preheat #oven{} to 180 degrees Celsius and prepare either one or two 20cm/8 inch cake pan(s). Line bottom with parchment paper. Then divide the eggs into @egg{5} white and egg yolks. Use a bigger bowl for the egg yolks. If you have a glass or metal bowl, use that one for the egg whites. Be sure that bowl is free of fat/grease and that your mixer was properly cleaned. First beat the egg whites on medium speed with a pinch of @salt{Pinch} until soft peaks form. Set aside. Without cleaning our mixer, beat the egg yolks with the @@@sugar{40g}{50g}{100g}. Beat until the color becomes much paler and you have a creamy consistency. This usually takes several minutes.
2 Gently pour one third of the egg whites on top of the mixed egg yolks and sift the flour and @@cornstarch{1 tsp}{30g} on top. Don't skip this step. It is important that the flour mix was sifted. Gently mix all ingredients with a spatula. Try to incorperate the flour mix and egg whites without losing volume. Add the last two thirds of beaten egg whites and gently fold the mixture. Don't overmix. Put batter into the prepared cake pans and immediately bake. Don't let the batter sit for too long as it will quickly lose volume. Bake for 35 minutes if using one springform or 25 minutes if using two. Let cool a little before gently getting them out of the form. Tip: if making the day before, wrap in cling wrap, it is much easier to cut in half once cold.
3 For the meringue beat @egg white{1} until soft peaks form, add pinch of salt and continue beating on high while adding the sugar. Beat for at least three more minutes until glossy and shiny. Pipe small stars or other shapes with the meringue on a #baking tray{} lined with parchment paper. Dry for about 45min at 100 degrees Celsius in the #oven{}. Keep in airtight container until further use.
4 For the filling beat @heavy cream{400g}, @vanilla extract{1 tsp} and sugar until stiff peaks form, slice @peaches{500g} in thin slices. Cut cake in four layers, this is much easier done once the cake layers are cold. Brush cake layer with some of the @peach juice{50 ml} left, then pipe thin layer of whipped cream around the edges, place the peach slices in the middle on first layer on cake, on the second layer only spread the @dulce de leche{200g}. Repeat layer with brushed peach juice, whipped cream and peaches for the third and final layer. Be sure to reserve enough peach slices for the top. Spread thin layer of whipped cream on the sides of the cake and pipe on some roses around the edges if desired. Heat the peach juice and mix the cornstarch with a bit of water until you see no lumps. Once juice is hot, add the cornstarch and stir until glaze thickenes. Pour over peaches of the top layer cake. Crush the meringue and pat around the sides. Serve immediately.`},

2) Using an electric mixer, I use my KitchenAid with the whisk attachment, whisk together the @cream cheese{450g}, vanilla, and @icing sugar{100g} until smooth and then add the @caramel{150g} and whisk again until smooth and lump free – this could take a couple of minutes, I whisk it at half speed so not too quick or slow!
3) Pour in the @double cream{300ml} & Salt flakes and continue to whisk for a couple of minutes until its very thick and mousse like (I mix it on a medium speed, level 6/10) – Now this could take up to 5 minutes depending on your mixer, but you seriously have to stick at it – it will hold itself completely when finished mixing (like a meringue does!) If you don’t mix it enough it will not set well enough, but don’t get impatient and whisk it really quick because that’ll make it split! Spread over the biscuit base and leave to set in the fridge overnight.
4) Remove the Cheesecake from the tin carefully and decorate the cheesecake – I drizzled over some of the spare caramel, and then some @toffee popcorn{Top} and more Pretzels!`},

Gather @all purpose flour{6 cups}, @unsalted butter{1 cup}, @vegetable shortening{1 cup}, @unsalted butter{2 tablespoons}.
To make the pastry, place the flour and @salt{2 tsp} in a large bowl. Mix well. Add the cubes of butter and shortening and mix them in (I like to use my hands to mix the fat into the flour, but you can use a pastry #blender{}) just until it looks like coarse oatmeal with some pea-sized bits remaining.
Place the @@egg{1 beaten}{1 large} in a 2-cup measure and beat it with a fork. Beat in the @vinegar{1 tablespoon} and just enough ice-cold @@water{1 tablespoon}{Splash} to bring it to the 1-cup mark.
Stir this into the flour mixture, just until the dough clings together. I like to use my hands for this part as well, but a wooden spoon would also work.
Try not to overmix it. On a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball and divide it into 5 evenly sized portions.
Shape each portion into a disc and wrap tightly in plastic. Chill 2 of these discs for 1 hour. Freeze the other 3 in a resealable freezer bag for future use.
The pastry keeps well in the freezer for up to 2 months. Preheat the #oven{} to 350°F. Place the rack in the lower third of the oven.
Line a #baking tray{} with aluminum foil to catch drippings. On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 disc of pastry into a 12-inch circle, or thereabouts.
Place it in the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate, with the pastry overhanging the edges of the pie plate. To make the filling, place the @saskatoon berries{5 Cups} in a large bowl and stir in the 1/2 cup @@sugar{1 tablespoon}{1/2 cup} and the @cornstarch{3  tablespoons} until well combined.
Pour the berry mixture into the bottom of the pie. Dot with the butter. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry in another 12-inch circle for the top crust.
Use a ruler to guide you when cutting the pastry into 6 wide, long strips to keep the edges straight. Save the 2 end pieces in case you need to do any patching.
I like wide strips, but if you like a thinner look, feel free to cut thin strips of pastry. Weave the pastry strips, going over and under, making sure they connect with the edges of the pie crust.
Fold over the edges of the bottom crust, tucking in the lattice ends. This will help to trap the juices and give a rustic look.
If you prefer a cleaner, tidier look, you can trim the overhanging pieces and crimp the edges with a fork. Brush the top of the pie with the egg wash.
Sprinkle with the remaining Tbsp sugar. Place the pie on the prepared #baking tray{} and bake it for about 90 – 100 minutes, until it’s golden brown and bubbling.
Remove the pie from the #oven{} and place it on a wire rack to cool. Serve the pie warm or at room temperature with whipped cream or ice cream.
Makes 6 servings. This keeps well if covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 4 days.`},

Gather @medjool dates{225g}, @self-raising flour{175g}, @demerara sugar{140g}, @ice cream{1 scoop}, @muscovado sugar{175g}, @double cream{225ml}.
Stone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling @water{175ml Boiling} over. Leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork.
Stir in the @vanilla extract{1 tsp}. @@butter{50g}{85g} and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a #baking tray{}.
Heat #oven{} to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. While the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and @bicarbonate of soda{1 tsp} together and beat the @eggs{2} in a separate bowl.
Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar).
Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the @@black treacle{1 tbsp}{2 tbsp} then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the @milk{100ml}, being careful not to overbeat.
Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter.
Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm. Meanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium #saucepan{} with half the cream.
Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn.
Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream. Remove the puddings from the #oven{}. Leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out.
You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce.
To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them.
Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t smudge (no need to chill). When ready to serve, heat #oven{} to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.
Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard.`},

Gather @unsalted butter{2 tbs}.
Pie Crust:  In a #blender{}, place the @flour{350g}, @salt{1 tsp}, and @@@sugar{Spinkling}{150g}{2 tbs} and process until combined. Add the @butter{1 cup} and process until the mixture resembles coarse
meal (about 15 seconds). Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) @water{1/2 cup} in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Turn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour.
After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).)  Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.5 cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling.
Remove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined #baking tray{}, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.
Make the Strawberry @rhubarb{450g} Filling: Place the cut @strawberries{450g} and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the @cornstarch{3 tbs}, sugar, and ground @cinnamon{1/4 tsp}.
Remove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of @lemon juice{1 tsp} and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.
Remove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with @milk{2 tbs} and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the #oven{} to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a #baking tray{}, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.)
Place the pie plate on the hot #baking tray{} and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.
Remove the pie from the #oven{} and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen.

Gather @blackberries{250g}, @redcurrants{100g}, @raspberries{500g}, @caster sugar{175g}.
Bring out the juices: Wash fruit and gently dry on kitchen paper – keep @strawberries{300g} separate. Put sugar and 3 tbsp water into a large pan.
Gently heat until sugar dissolves – stir a few times. Bring to a boil for 1 min, then tip in the fruit (not strawberries).
Cook for 3 mins over a low heat, stirring 2-3 times. The fruit will be softened, mostly intact and surrounded by dark red juice.
Put a sieve over a bowl and tip in the fruit and juice. Line the bowl with cling film and prepare the @bread{7 Slices}: Line the 1.25-litre basin with cling film as this will help you to turn out the pudding.
Overlap two pieces of cling film in the middle of the bowl as it’s easier than trying to get one sheet to stick to all of the curves.
Let the edges overhang by about 15cm. Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half, a little on an angle, to give 2 lopsided rectangles per piece.
Cut 2 slices into 4 triangles each and leave the final piece whole. Build the pud: Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for a few secs just to coat.
Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the wonky rectangular pieces one at a time and press around the basin’s sides so that they fit together neatly, alternately placing wide and narrow ends up.
If you can’t quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn’t matter, just trim into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in.
Now spoon in the softened fruit, adding the strawberries here and there as you go. Let flavours mingle then serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top – trim off overhang with scissors.
Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or overnight.
To serve, open out cling film then put a serving plate upside-down on top and flip over. serve with leftover juice, any extra berries and cream.`},

Gather @plain flour{Dusting}, @braeburn apples{6}, @caster sugar{100g}, @creme fraiche{to serve}.
Roll the pastry to a 3mm-thick round on a lightly floured surface and cut a 24cm circle, using a plate as a guide. Lightly prick all over with a fork, wrap in cling film on a #baking tray{} and freeze while preparing the apples.
Heat #oven{} to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Put the sugar in a flameproof 20cm ceramic Tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based #skillet{} and place over a medium-high heat.
Cook the sugar for 5-7 mins to a dark amber caramel syrup that’s starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir in the 60g diced chilled @butter{85g}.
To assemble the Tarte Tatin, arrange the apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish first, rounded-side down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion.
Gently press with your hands to ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter. Bake in the #oven{} for 30 mins, then remove and place the disc of frozen @puff pastry{300g} on top – it will quickly defrost.
Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake for a further 40-45 mins until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.
Allow to cool to room temperature for 1 hr before running a knife around the edge of the dish and inverting it onto a large serving plate that is deep enough to contain the juices.
Serve with crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream.`},

Gather @plain flour{250g}, @golden syrup{400g}, @lemons{Zest of 2}, @eggs{1 beaten}.
First make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in the @butter{135g} with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine @breadcrumbs{150g} (alternatively, this can be done in a #blender{}).
Add about three tablespoons of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes.
Preheat the #oven{} to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and put a heavy #baking tray{} in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed fluted flan tin with butter.
Remove about 150g/5½oz of pastry from the main ball and set aside for the lattice top. Roll the rest of the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry.
Prick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking. Place the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly.
Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage.
Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture. To make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil.
Once melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.
Pour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface. Remove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/½in wide.
Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin. Egg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.
Once the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish.
Bake on the pre-heated #baking tray{} in the hot #oven{} for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
If at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil. Bake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set.
Remove the tart from the #oven{} and leave to firm up in the tin. Serve warm or cold.`},

Grind the cashew, poppy seeds and @@cumin seeds{1 tbsp}{½ tbsp} into a smooth paste, using as little water as possible. Set aside.
Deep fry the sliced @onions{3 sliced thinly} when it is hot. Don’t overcrowd the oil. When the onions turn light brown, remove from oil and drain on paper towel. The fried onion will crisp up as it drains. Also fry the cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside.
Wash the rice and soak in water for twenty minutes. Meanwhile, take a big wide pan, add oil in medium heat, add the sliced onions, add the blended paste, to it add the green chillies, @ginger @garlic{4 whole} paste{2 tsp} and garlic and fry for a minute. Then add the tomatoes and sauté them well till they are cooked and not mushy.
Then to it add the @red chilli powder{1 tsp}, biryani powder, @mint{Leaves}, coriander leaves and sauté them well. Add the yogurt and mix well. I always move the #skillet{} away from the heat when adding yogurt which prevents it from curdling.
Now after returning the #skillet{} back to the stove, add the washed @lamb{1 lb} and salt and ½ cup water and mix well. Cook for 1 hour and cook it covered in medium low heat or put it in a pressure cooker for 6 whistles. If the water is not drained totally, heat it by keeping it open.
Take another big pan, add thrice the cup of rice you use, and boil it. When it is boiling high, add the rice, salt and jeera and mix well. After 7 minutes exact or when the rice is 80% done. Switch off and drain the rice.
Now, the layering starts. To the lamb, pat and level it. Add the drained hot rice on the top of it. Garnish with fried onions, @ghee{2 tbsp}, mint, coriander leaves and @saffron{½ tsp dissolved in ½ cup warm milk} dissolved in milk.
Cover the dish and bake in a 350f #oven{} for 15 minutes or till the cooked but not mushy. Or cook in the stove medium heat for 12 minutes and lowest heat for 5 minutes. And switch off. Mix and serve hot! Notes 1. If you are cooking in oven, do make sure to cook in a big oven safe pan and cover it tight and then keep in oven for the final step. 2. You can skip @biryani masala{1 tbsp} if you don’t have and add just garam masala (1 tsp and red chilli powder – 3 tsp instead of 1 tsp) 3. If it is spicy in the end, squeeze some lemon, it will reduce the heat and enhance the flavors also.`},

Gather @olive oil{2 tbsp}, @caster sugar{1 tsp}, @fennel bulb{1 large}, @lamb mince{400g}, @onion{1 medium}, @potatoes{1 small peeled and coarsely grated}, @chopped parsley{2 tbsp}, @clove{½ tsp ground}, @cinnamon{½ tsp ground}.
Use pickled @vine leaves{50} here, preserved in brine. Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling.
And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use.
@basmati rice{2 tbsp} with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four. First make the filling.
Put all the ingredients, apart from the @@tomatoes{2 medium}{800g peeled and chopped}, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins.
Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.
To make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the @ginger{4cm piece finely chopped} and @@garlic{2 cloves}{2 cloves peeled and chopped}, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, @@lemon juice{1 tbsp}{2 tbsp} and sugar.
Season, and simmer for 20 minutes. While the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy #saucepan{}.
Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.
Lay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip.
Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).
Pour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm.
When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with @coriander{2 tbsp chopped}.`},

Heat a large #skillet{} and toast the @cumin{2 tsp} seeds for a few minutes, then set aside. Heat the oil in the same pan and fry the onion, garlic, chilli, @pepper{1 tsp} and a good pinch of @salt{½ tsp} for around eight minutes, until there is no moisture left.
Remove from the heat, stir in the toasted cumin seeds, ground mace (or @nutmeg{1 tsp}) and ground @@coriander{3 tbs}{2 tsp}. Leave to cool. In a large bowl mix together the minced lamb, white pepper, fresh coriander, and the cooled spiced onion mixture until combined.
Set aside, covered, in the fridge. Preheat the #oven{} to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and generously grease a 20cm/8in diameter loose-bottomed or springform round cake tin with @lard{150g}.
To make the pastry, sift the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Put the @milk{90 ml}, lard and 90ml/3fl oz of water in a #saucepan{} and heat gently.
When the lard has melted, increase the heat and bring to the boil. Pour the boiling liquid into the flour, and use a wooden spoon to combine until cool enough to handle.
Bring together into a ball. Dust a work surface with flour and, working quickly, knead the dough briefly – it will be soft and moist.
Set aside a third of the pastry and roll the rest out on a well-floured surface. Line the pie dish with the pastry, pressing it right up the sides until it pokes just over the top of the tin.
Add the filling into the pastry-lined tin bit by bit. As you reach the top, form a slight peak. Roll out the reserved pastry and top the pie with it.
Pinch the edges to seal and trim the excess. Poke a hole in the top of the pie and insert a small tube made from aluminium foil to allow steam to escape.
Brush the top of the pie with a little beaten egg yolk, and bake in the preheated #oven{} for 30 minutes (put a tray on the shelf below to catch any drips).
Then reduce the temperature to 160C/325F/Gas 3 and cook for a further 1¼ hours until golden-brown. Leave to cool completely before refrigerating for two hours, or overnight.
Run a knife around the edge of the pie, remove from the tin and serve with chutneys, salads or pickles.`},

To make the spice mix, combine all of the ingredients together with a large pinch of salt. Slash the @lamb shoulder{2.5kg} all over with a sharp knife and rub in. If you have the time, marinate for up to 24 hrs, but this is not essential.

Gather @sea salt{Handful}, @bay leaf{4}, @thyme{Handful}, @white wine{100ml}.
The day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the @garlic{4 cloves} and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish.
Lay the @duck legs{4}, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight.
This can be done up to 2 days ahead. Pour the wine into a #saucepan{} that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine.
Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat. As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.) After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded.
Leave to cool. The duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately – or you can follow the next step if you like them crisp.
If you are preparing ahead, pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan.
Cover and leave in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.
To reheat and crisp up the duck legs, heat #oven{} to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Remove the legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof #skillet{}.
Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.`},

Gather @tarragon leaves{3 chopped}, @parsley{1 tbs chopped}, @chives{1 tbs chopped}, @gruyère{4 tbs}.
Get everything ready. Warm a 20cm (measured across the top) non-stick #skillet{} on a medium heat. Crack the @eggs{3} into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg.
With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of @butter{2 knobs} into the pan. It should bubble and sizzle, but not brown. Season the eggs with the @parmesan{1 tsp} and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan.
Let the eggs bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the centre.
Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked egg with cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left.
With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top.
A quick burst of heat will brown the underside. Grip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge.
Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier.
For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze.
Serve immediately.`},

Gather @olive oil{2 tablespoons}, @carrots{1 chopped into ½-inch pieces}, @dry white wine{1 cup}, @chicken stock{½ cup}.
Heat the #oven{} to 300 degrees. Dredging the shanks: pour the @flour{½ cup} into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely). Season the @veal{4 meaty shanks} shanks on all sides with salt and pepper.
One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining flour.
Browning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the @butter{3 tablespoons} in a wide Dutch #oven{} or heavy braising #pot{} (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat.
When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the #pot{}, flat side down; if the shanks won’t fit without touching one another, do this in batches.
Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit.
Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside. The aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the #pot{}. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits.
Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the #pot{} and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the @onion{1 medium chopped into ½-inch pieces}, carrot, @celery{1 chopped into ½-inch pieces}, and @fennel{1 bulb chopped into ½-inch pieces}.
Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the @@garlic{1 teaspoon minced}{3 cloves}, @orange zest{2 strips}, @marjoram{1 ½ teaspoons}, and @bay leaf{1}, and stew for another minute or two.
The braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes.
Add the stock and @tomatoes{1 cup chopped with juice}, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.
The braise: Place the shanks in the #pot{} so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat.
Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the #pot{} by about an inch.
Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the #oven{} to braise at a gentle simmer. Check the #pot{} after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees.
Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours.
The gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, @parsley{2 tablespoons chopped}, and @lemon zest{1 teaspoon grated} in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.) The finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata.
Return the veal to the #oven{}, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some. Using a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact.
The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky.
But if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.
Finishing the sauce: Set the braising #pot{} on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it.
Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes.
Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata. Portioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person.
If the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts.
Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most. Serving: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving.
Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce – the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.`},

Gather @plain flour{5 tbs}, @english mustard{½ tsp}, @eggs{3}, @goats cheese{8 slices}, @double cream{150ml}, @spinach{to serve}.
Heat #oven{} to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and @butter{50g} 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins. Sprinkle the @parmesan{25g} into the ramekins, turning until all sides are covered.
Place the @milk{300ml} and @bay leaves{2} in a large #saucepan{} over a gentle heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 mins.
Discard the bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 mins until you get a smooth, thick white sauce.
Make sure that you get right into the corners of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy. Once thickened, transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, @cayenne pepper{Pod of}, @gruyère{140g} and egg yolks until fully combined.
In a spotlessly clean bowl and with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form. Carefully fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold, rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy.
Fill the prepared ramekins with the soufflé mix. Top each soufflé with a slice of goat’s cheese, then place on a #baking tray{}.
Bake for 20-25 mins or until springy and well risen but cooked through. Leave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish and remove the soufflés.
If preparing in advance, place soufflés upside down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month.
When ready to re-bake, heat #oven{} to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the upside-down soufflés in a shallow #baking tray{}, top with the remaining goat’s cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops them from drying out when baked for the second time).
Cook for 8-10 mins until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad.`},

Make the mac and cheese
1. Bring a medium #saucepan{} of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions. The pasta should be tender but still chewy. 2. While the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, @mustard powder{3/4 teaspoon}, @@garlic powder{1 teaspoon}{1/2 teaspoon}, salt, @black pepper{1/2 teaspoon}, and @cayenne pepper{1/8 teaspoon}. 3. Drain the pasta in a colander. Place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the @@@butter{4 tablespoons (55 grams)}{4 tablespoons (55 grams)}{6 tablespoons (85 grams)}. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Watch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan. 4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta. 5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed #baking tray{} with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.
Make the grilled cheese 6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick #skillet{} over medium-low heat. 7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended. 8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.) 9. Spread 3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each @bread{16 slices square} slice. Place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the #baking tray{} by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up. 10. Using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more. 11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve.`},

Gather @olive oil{1 tblsp}, @carrots{1 medium}, @minced beef{500g}, @tomato puree{1 tbls}, @lasagne sheets{500g}, @creme fraiche{400ml}, @mozzarella balls{125g}, @parmesan cheese{50g}, @basil leaves{Topping}.
Heat the oil in a large #saucepan{}. Use kitchen scissors to snip the @bacon{2} into small pieces, or use a sharp knife to chop it on a chopping board.
Add the bacon to the pan and cook for just a few mins until starting to turn golden. Add the @onion{1 finely chopped}, @celery{1 Stick} and carrot, and cook over a medium heat for 5 mins, stirring occasionally, until softened.
Add the @garlic{2 cloves chopped} and cook for 1 min, then tip in the mince and cook, stirring and breaking it up with a wooden spoon, for about 6 mins until browned all over.
Stir in the tomato purée and cook for 1 min, mixing in well with the beef and vegetables. Tip in the @chopped tomatoes{800g}. Fill each can half full with water to rinse out any tomatoes left in the can, and add to the pan.
Add the @honey{1 tblsp} and season to taste. Simmer for 20 mins. Heat #oven{} to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. To assemble the lasagne, ladle a little of the ragu sauce into the bottom of the roasting tin or #casserole dish{}, spreading the sauce all over the base.
Place 2 sheets of lasagne on top of the sauce overlapping to make it fit, then repeat with more sauce and another layer of pasta.
Repeat with a further 2 layers of sauce and pasta, finishing with a layer of pasta. Put the crème fraîche in a bowl and mix with 2 tbsp water to loosen it and make a smooth pourable sauce.
Pour this over the top of the pasta, then top with the mozzarella. Sprinkle Parmesan over the top and bake for 25–30 mins until golden and bubbling.
Serve scattered with basil, if you like.`},

Gather @egg yolks{6}, @bacon{150g}.
Put a large #saucepan{} of water on to boil.
Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g @pecorino{50g} cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated @black pepper{As required}. Set everything aside.
Add 1 tsp @salt{As required} to the boiling water, add 350g @spaghetti{320g} and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.
While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large #skillet{} or #wok{} and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the #skillet{} with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.`},

Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the @duck legs{4} and brown on all sides for about 10 mins. Remove to a plate and set aside.
Add the @onions{2 finely chopped} to the pan and cook for 5 mins until softened. Add the @garlic{2 cloves minced} and cook for a further 1 min, then stir in the @cinnamon{2 tsp ground} and flour and cook for a further min.
Return the duck to the pan, add the wine, tomatoes, stock, herbs, @sugar{1 tsp} and seasoning. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat, cover with a lid and cook for 2 hrs, stirring every now and then.
Carefully lift the duck legs out of the sauce and place on a plate – they will be very tender so try not to lose any of the meat.
Pull off and discard the fat, then shred the meat with 2 forks and discard the bones. Add the meat back to the sauce with the @milk{2 tbs} and simmer, uncovered, for a further 10-15 mins while you cook the pasta.
Cook the pasta following pack instructions, then drain, reserving a cup of the pasta water, and add the pasta to the ragu.
Stir to coat all the pasta in the sauce and cook for 1 min more, adding a splash of cooking liquid if it looks dry. Serve with grated Parmesan, if you like.`},

Gather @butter{1 tbs}, @garlic clove{1 chopped}, @brussels sprouts{20}, @potatoes{400g}.
Melt the fat in a non-stick pan, allow it to get nice and hot, then add the @bacon{4}. As it begins to brown, add the @onion{1 finely sliced} and garlic.
Next, add the sliced sprouts or cabbage and let it colour slightly. All this will take 5-6 mins. Next, add the potato. Work everything together in the pan and push it down so that the mixture covers the base of the pan – allow the mixture to catch slightly on the base of the pan before turning it over and doing the same again.
It’s the bits of potato that catch in the pan that define the term ‘bubble and squeak’, so be brave and let the mixture colour.
Cut into wedges and serve.`},

Sprinkle the rice around the pork belly, pushing it underneath the stock. Let the stock come to the boil again, season well, then transfer to the #oven{} (leave it uncovered).

Preheat the #oven{} to 350°. Remove the stems from one bunch of Tuscan @kale{1  bunch} and tear the leaves into 1" pieces (mustard greens, collards, spinach, and chard are great, too). Coarsely chop half a head of green @cabbage{1 Head chopped}. Combine the greens in a large #baking tray{} and add 4 cloves of thinly sliced garlic. Adding some sliced onions and @shiitake mushrooms{Sliced} at this point is optional, but highly recommended (I'll sauté the onions and mushrooms in a cast iron baking dish right on the stove before adding to the greens). Coat the greens with some olive oil and pour ½ cup @chicken stock{1 cup} or broth over everything. Cover the dish with foil and bake until the greens are wilted, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and season with @salt{} and @pepper{}. Continue to bake until cabbage is tender, about 20-25 minutes more.
Meanwhile, heat a little olive oil in a large #skillet{} over medium-high. Prick four sweet Italian sausages with a fork and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. When the greens are done, slice the sausage and toss into the greens with a splash of your favorite vinegar (I like sherry or red wine).`},

Gather @plain flour{75g}, @sunflower oil{For frying}, @extra virgin olive oil{4 tbsp}, @jamón ibérico{70g}, @plain flour{60g}, @vegetable stock{75 ml}.
To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a pan until it starts to shimmer. Add the @leek{1/2} and sauté until soft but not coloured. Stir in the ham with a wooden spoon, fry for 1 min, then stir in the flour and fry over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is golden but not burnt – this will take about 5 mins.
Meanwhile, combine the stock and @milk{330ml} in a small pan and heat until steaming but not boiling. Season with a few scrapes of @nutmeg{Grated}. Gradually add the liquid, a few tbsp at a time, stirring constantly.
Once you’ve incorporated all the milk stock, continue to cook the filling over a medium heat for about 10 mins or until it thickens and leaves the sides of the pan when you stir it.
Season with black pepper, taste and adjust the salt if necessary – the ham can be very salty to start with. The filling is now done: it has to be really thick because you don’t want the croquetas to turn into pancakes.
Smooth the mixture onto a #baking tray{} (30 x 20cm is fine). Once it has stopped steaming, cover with cling film to stop it drying out. Leave to cool before putting it in the fridge for 1 hr.
When you're ready for the next stage, line up three bowls: the first filled with the flour, the second with beaten @egg{2 large} and the third with @breadcrumbs{75g}. Take the ham mixture out of the fridge. Put a little bit of olive oil on your hands to make it easier to roll the croquetas.
Roll a spoonful of the mixture between your palms. The size and shape of the croquetas is up to you, but the easiest is a walnut-sized ball. Then begin coating as follows.
Dunk the croquetas into the flour – you want a dusting – followed by the egg, then the breadcrumbs. Put them on a tray and, when you’ve used up all the mixture, place in the fridge for 30 mins.
If you have a deep-fat fryer, heat the oil to 180C and fry for a couple of mins. If not, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed #saucepan{} until it starts to shimmer. Then add 5-6 croquetas at a time and fry until golden all over. Once cooked, drain on kitchen paper and eat straight away.`},

Gather @olive oil{45g}, @jamón ibérico{80g}, @vegetable oil{1 L}.
Wash the @wild garlic leaves{150g} well in a colander, then pour over boiling water from the kettle until just wilted. Immediately rinse under cold running water, then squeeze out the excess water and finely chop.
Warm the @milk{350g} in a pan over a low heat until just steaming. Heat the oil or butter in a second pan and, once warm or melted, stir in the @flour{65g} for a couple of minutes until it starts to brown a little. Gradually add the warm milk, a little at a time, until you have a thick, silky sauce. Bubble for a minute or two, stirring to make sure all the flour has cooked out. Season.
Add the @manchego{35g}, jamón and wild garlic to the pan, and beat to combine. Tip out onto a lightly oiled #baking tray{} or plate, spread out then cover and chill for at least 1 hr. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.
Lightly oil your hands and shape the mixture into 18-20 even-sized balls. Arrange on a #baking tray{} and freeze for 30 mins to firm up.
Beat the @egg{1} in a shallow dish with a little seasoning. Tip the panko into a second dish. Dip each of the croquetas in the egg, then turn to coat in the @breadcrumbs{75g}. At this point, the raw croquetas can be frozen for up to three months. Pour the oil into a large, deep pan ensuring it is no more than a third full and heat to 170C, or until a cube of bread browns lightly in 30 seconds. Fry the croquetas in batches for 2-3 mins until deeply golden. To cook from frozen, fry at 160C for a few minutes longer until they’re piping hot inside. Remove to a sheet of kitchen paper using a slotted spoon and leave to drain. Serve warm with a glass of sherry.`},

Gather @white wine{200ml}, @lemon juice{1/2}, @olive oil{Dash}, @vegetable oil{For frying}.
Cut the tenderloins into 5 equal-size pieces leaving the tail ends a little longer. Take a clear plastic bag and slip one of the pieces in. Bash it into an escalope the size of a side-plate with a rolling pin and repeat with the remaining pieces.
Put the wine, @paprika{1/2 tsp}, some salt and pepper and the juice of ½ a @lemon{2} in a bowl and add the @pork{2}. Leave to marinate for 20-30 minutes, while you get your barbecue to the stage where the coals are glowing but there are no flames.
To make the chips, fill a basin with cool water and cut the @potatoes{1 kg} into 3cm-thick chips. Soak them in the water for 5 minutes and then change the water. Leave for 5 more minutes. Drain and then pat dry on a towel or with kitchen paper.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a deep heavy-based pan with a lid to 130C and lower the chips into the oil (in batches). Blanch for 8-10 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain well. Place on a tray to cool. Reheat the oil to 180C (make sure it’s hot or your chips will be soggy) and lower the basket of chips into the oil (again, do this in batches). Leave to cook for 2 minutes and then give them a little shake. Cook for another minute or so until they are well coloured and crisp to the touch. Drain well for a few minutes, tip into a bowl and sprinkle with sea salt.
The pork will cook quickly so do it in 2 batches. Take the pieces out of the marinade, rub them with oil, and drop them onto the barbecue (you could also use a chargrill). Cook for 1 minute on each side – they may flare up as you do so. This should really be enough time as they will keep on cooking. Take them off the barbecue and pile onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining batch.
Serve by piling a plate with chips, drop the pork on top of each pile and pouring the juices from the plate over so the chips take up the flavours. Top with a spoon of @mayonnaise{To serve} and a wedge of lemon.`},

Gather @sausages{1}, @red potatoes{2 Lbs}, @bouillon cubes{4}, @freshly chopped parsley{Pinch}, @swede{1}.
Raspeballer & (Optional) Salted Meat ▢ If you're making @pork knuckle{1}, cook it in simmering water for about 3 hours, until the meat falls from the bone. Remove the pork and save the broth to cook the raspeballer. ▢ Boil the boiled @potatoes{1 lb} and peel once cooled. Also peel the raw potatoes, and then grate them or run them through a #blender{}. Use a paper towel to remove some of the moisture from the grated potatoes. ▢ Mash the boiled potatoes in a potato ricer or with a masher. Make sure there are no lumps. Add the grated raw potatoes to the mashed potatoes in a large #mixing bowl{} and stir together. Add the barley @flour{1 1/4 cup}, @all purpose flour{2 tblsp}, and @salt{1 teaspoon} and mix together with your hands until the mixture is fully blended. ▢ You can cook the raspeballer in either vegetable or beef broth, or if you're making pork knuckle, cook them in the broth from the pork knuckle. Bring the broth to a very light simmer – you don't want it to fully boil because then the raspeballer might break apart. ▢ Use a tablespoon dipped in cold water to shape each raspeball in your hand. Try to make them as smooth as possible and then gently drop them into the simmering broth. Dip the tablespoon in a bowl of cold water between each raspeball. ▢ Let the raspeballer simmer for about 30 minutes. If you're making smoked sausage, you can heat the sausage in the same #pot{} with the raspeballer. Top with fresh chopped parsley.
Mashed Rutabaga ▢ Peel the rutabaga and @carrots{2} and cut into small pieces. Boil in water for about 30 minutes, or until tender. Then drain the water, add the @cream{1/4 cup}/milk, @butter{1 tblsp} and @nutmeg{1 teaspoon} and mash until smooth. ▢ Serve alongside the raspeballer and meat.`},

Gather @apples{1}, @chicken stock{1}, @vegetable oil{1 tbsp}.
Serves 2
1.
Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat #oven{} to 450 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice sweet @potatoes{2} into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss on a #baking tray{} with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack for 12 minutes (we'll roast the @zucchini{1} then).
2.
Meanwhile, halve and core apple; thinly slice into half-moons. Peel and finely chop @garlic{2 cloves}. Quarter @lemon{1}. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick half-moons. Toss on a second #baking tray{} with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside.
3.
Pat @pork{2} dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate.
4.
Once sweet potatoes have roasted 12 minutes, transfer #baking tray{} with zucchini to middle rack and continue roasting until both veggies are browned and softened, 12-15 minutes more.
5.
Meanwhile, melt 1 TBSP @butter{2 tbsp} (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for pork over medium-high heat. Add apple and season with salt and pepper. Cook, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until apple is slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add 1/z cup water (3/4 cup for 4), stock concentrate, and 11/2 tsp @sugar{1 1/2 tsp} (3 tsp for 4). Cook, stirring, until sauce has thickened and apple is very tender, 3-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
6.
Remove pan with apple from heat; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and a squeeze of lemon juice. Divide pork, zucchini, and sweet potatoes between plates. Top pork with glazed apple sauce. Top zucchini with a squeeze of lemon juice.`},

Stir in the oil, then spread the mixture over the @pork shoulder{2kg}, avoiding the skin on top. Score the skin using a sharp knife, then rub a large pinch of salt into the skin. Tie the pork together using kitchen string.
Line a large #baking tray{} with a double layer of foil and put the pork on top, skin-side up. Bring the sides of the foil up around the pork to create a parcel, then pour the wine into the tray around the sides. Transfer to the #oven{} and reduce the temperature to 140C/120C fan/gas 1. Roast for 4-5 hrs, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the pork reads 70C.

Meanwhile, arrange the foil around the meat so only the skin is exposed, then return to the #oven{} for 10-15 mins until the skin is puffed up and browned all over. Leave to rest for 20 mins before slicing. Serve with the sauce drizzled over.`},

Gather @vegetable oil{Fry}, @tomato ketchup{2 tbs}, @worcestershire sauce{2 tbs}, @oyster sauce{1 tbs}, @caster sugar{2 tblsp}.
Remove the large piece of fat on the edge of each pork loin, then bash each of the loins between two pieces of baking parchment until around 1cm in thickness – you can do this using a meat tenderiser or a rolling pin. Once bashed, use your hands to reshape the meat to its original shape and thickness – this step will ensure the meat is as succulent as possible.
Put the @flour{100g}, @eggs{2 Beaten} and panko @breadcrumbs{100g} into three separate wide-rimmed bowls. Season the meat, then dip first in the flour, followed by the eggs, then the breadcrumbs.
In a large frying or sauté pan, add enough oil to come 2cm up the side of the pan. Heat the oil to 180C – if you don’t have a thermometer, drop a bit of panko into the oil and if it sinks a little then starts to fry, the oil is ready. Add two @pork chops{4} and cook for 1 min 30 secs on each side, then remove and leave to rest on a wire rack for 5 mins. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.
While the pork is resting, make the sauce by whisking the ingredients together, adding a splash of water if it’s particularly thick. Slice the tonkatsu and serve drizzled with the sauce.`},

Gather @ground cumin{1/2 teaspoon}, @coriander{1/2 tsp}, @paprika{Pinch}, @chili powder{Pinch}, @garlic clove{2}, @lemon{Juice of 1}, @coriander{Bunch}.
Tip all the dressing ingredients into a #blender{} with a pinch of salt and blitz to a dressing. Slash the fish three times on each side, coat with half of the dressing, then set aside to marinate for about 30 mins.
Heat #oven{} to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Place the fish on a roasting tray, then cook in the oven for 20 mins until the flesh is firm and the eyes have turned white. Serve the fish with the rest of the dressing and steamed couscous or rice.
KNOW HOW: HOW TO COOK IT: Cooking @barramundi{2 x 400g} on the bone, as we have done here, has its advantages – it will stay more moist during cooking, and some would say that the flavour is enhanced, too. If you want to take out the bones they are easy to locate and less likely to be lodged in the fillet if the fish is cooked whole. Fillets can be simply pan-fried or grilled. If you like trout, you will really enjoy the flavour of barramundi, which lends itself to similar ingredients and cooking methods – citrus flavours are particularly good, as are garlic and wild mushrooms. Simply roasting the fish with some fresh herbs, @olive oil{5 tablespoons} and seasoning is delicious, and in the summer months you could barbecue it, too. One thing that you mustn’t miss are the cheeks or ‘pearls’ of the fish, these are simply lovely, moist and really sweet – well worth leaving the head on for!`},

Cooking in a @cajun{2 tbsp} spice and @cayenne pepper{1 tsp} marinade makes this fish super succulent and flavoursome. Top with a zesty dressing and serve in a tortilla for a quick, fuss-free main that's delightfully summery.
On a large plate, mix the cajun spice and cayenne pepper with a little seasoning and use to coat the fish all over.
Heat a little oil in a #skillet{}, add in the fish and cook over a medium heat until golden. Reduce the heat and continue frying until the fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Cook in batches if you don’t have enough room in the pan.
Meanwhile, prepare the dressing by combining all the ingredients with a little seasoning. Soften the tortillas by heating in the microwave for 5-10 seconds.

Gather @unsalted beef stock{1 cup}, @kosher salt{1/2 tsp}, @spring onions{1}, @mung bean sprouts{1 cup}, @jasmine rice{2 cups}.
Make the gravy: In a small #saucepan{}, add the beef stock, @soy sauce{1 tablespoon}, @shaoxing wine{1 tablespoon}, @oyster sauce{1 tablespoon}, and white @pepper{1/2 tsp} powder over medium heat. Whisk together and bring to a simmer.
Combine the @@cornstarch{1 tablespoon}{1 tablespoon} and @@water{1 tablespoon}{1 tablespoon} in a small bowl and whisk to dissolve. Add to the #saucepan{} and whisk until the gravy thickens and coats the back of the spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Cover the saucepan with a lid and keep it warm on the lowest possible heat.
Make the @egg{8 large} foo young batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water until dissolved. Add the eggs, salt, and @sugar{1/4 tsp}. Whisk until well combined and there are no more egg white clumps.
Add the green onion, bean sprouts, and @shrimp{20}. Stir until everything is evenly coated.
Fry the egg foo young: Add the @vegetable oil{3 Cups} to a large #wok{}; it should reach about 2 inches up the sides. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 350°F, or until vigorous bubbles form around an inserted wooden chopstick.
With a ladle, gently and slowly add 1/4 of the omelet batter. Egg foo young should immediately bubble and puff up like magic. Fry until golden brown and crispy on each side, about 2 minutes per side. If there are any light spots, use a ladle to gently baste it with hot oil.
Tip Egg foo young can be a bit tricky to flip. The easiest method is to put a tool in each hand (a spider, slotted spoon, tongs, and large chopsticks are all good candidates) and gently coax the omelet over, pulling up on one side and pushing down and around on the other.
Remove the omelet and place it on a paper towel-lined #baking tray{}. Let it cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat with the remaining batter to make 4 omelets. If needed, add more oil to the pan between batches.
Serve and enjoy: Plate each egg foo young over a bed of rice. Spoon the warm gravy over the top and serve immediately.`},

Season to taste. The sauce can be made ahead, then reheated later in the day. Meantime, scrub the @mussels{Handful} or clams and pull away any stringy beards.
Any that are open should be tapped sharply on the worktop – if they don’t close after a few seconds, discard them. Reheat the sauce if necessary, then stir the potato, chunks of fish and prawns very gently into the stew.
Bring back to the boil, then cover and gently simmer for 3 mins. Scatter the mussels or clams over the stew, then cover and cook for 2 mins more or until the shells have opened wide.
Discard any that remain closed. The chunks of fish should flake easily and the prawns should be pink through. Scatter with the @thyme{2} leaves.
To make the quick rouille, stir the rest of the harissa through the mayonnaise. Serve the stew in bowls, topped with spoonfuls of rouille, which will melt into the sauce and enrich it.

Gather @kosher salt{1 tsp}.
@dried shrimp{2 tablespoons} gives this Chinese dish a punch of salty umami flavor. You can find it at an Asian grocery store in the frozen or refrigerated section. Look for small-sized dried shrimp, about a 1/4-inch in size. If you use medium or large dried shrimp, hydrate the shrimp with more @water{1 tablespoon} (1 cup for medium-sized shrimp, 1 1/4 cup for large) and for longer time (45 to 60 minutes), then chop it up into smaller 1/4-inch chunks. To make this recipe vegetarian, omit the dried shrimp and use four or five dried shiitake mushrooms, rehydrated, and sliced thin.
Rehydrate the dried shrimp: Place the dried shrimp in a small bowl and pour the @boiling water{3/4 cup} over it. Cover with a small plate and let sit for 30 minutes so the shrimp can rehydrate. The shrimp will be lighter in color and plump up slightly.
Prep the cabbage: Meanwhile, split the @napa cabbage{1 head} in half lengthwise. Rinse the cabbage and shake it dry. Cut out the core of the cabbage and discard.
Set out two large bowls. Cut the remaining cabbage into 1-inch pieces, putting the thicker white pieces at the bottom of the cabbage into one bowl and the top thinner leafy green pieces into the other bowl.
Drain the shrimp: Once the shrimp has rehydrated, drain it and discard the liquid.
Cook the shrimp and cabbage: In a large #wok{} or #skillet{} over high heat add the @peanut oil{2 tablespoons}, swirling it around to coat the pan.
Heat until the oil looks shimmering hot, then carefully add the @scallions{4 Chopped}, @ginger{1 tablespoon}, and rehydrated shrimp, paying specially attention as the wet ingredients may cause the hot oil to splatter. Toss with a spatula until the scallions are bright green and the entire mixture is fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add the thicker white part of the napa cabbage to the pan and lower the heat to medium high. Continue to cook and stir for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the edges of the cabbage pieces start to look slightly translucent but the center of the cabbage pieces are still opaque white.
Reduce the heat to medium low and add the leafy green pieces of cabbage into the pan. Cook until the leaves are wilted, about 2 minutes.
Make a @cornstarch{2 tsp} slurry: In a small bowl, combine the @soy sauce{1 tablespoon}, cold water, and cornstarch, stirring to make a slurry. Then pour over the cabbage and continue to cook and stir until a sauce has thickened slightly to the consistency of whole milk.
Season the stir fry: Season the stir fry with salt and @pepper{1/2 tsp}, then taste and add more salt and pepper if you wish. The cabbage will be translucent and silky looking, with specks of dried shrimp all over.`},

Gather @raw tiger prawns{10}, @dry sherry{100 ml}, @tomato{2}, @paella rice{250g}.
Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a wide, shallow pan. Add the prawn heads and @parsley{Bunch} stalks and sizzle until the heads turn pink, then mash with a potato masher. Pour over the sherry or wine and 300ml water, season with salt and simmer for 10 mins to make a stock, mashing the prawn heads as they cook.
Scatter the @mussels{500g} into the pan, cover the pan loosely with a lid or tea towel, then put over a high heat for 3-4 mins until the mussels just open. Stir to release the mussel juices, then pour the contents of the pan into a colander set over a large bowl containing the @saffron{Pinch}. Let the saffron steep in the stock – you will need 700ml in total, so top up with water if needed and give everything a good stir. Pick the mussels out from the colander, then set aside.
Wipe out the pan and add the rest of the @olive oil{3 tablespoons}. Sizzle the @chorizo{150g} until it releases its oil, then add the @onion{1 chopped} and @garlic{3 cloves} and cook until softened. Add the @squid{1 medium} and turn over until it turns white. Add the tomatoes and cook down for a minute, then pour over most of the stock, give everything a good stir and bring to the boil. Scatter the rice over the stock, stir well once, then boil vigorously for 5 mins. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and slowly simmer for 10 mins without stirring until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid.
Tuck the prawn tails into the rice and simmer for 5 mins, turning them over until cooked through. Stir through the mussels and @broad beans{100g} or peas. Taste the rice – if it is still a little raw but the pan is dry, add a splash more stock and continue to cook; if it’s too soupy, then increase the heat to cook off the last of the stock.
Once the rice is just cooked, turn off the heat and cover with a tea towel for a few minutes. Scatter over the parsley leaves and @lemon zest{1}, then season with smoked salt if you like. Stir everything once, then serve straight from the pan, with lemon wedges on the side.`},

Grill for 2 minutes, turn the tomato, then grill for a further 2 minutes. Remove the tomato with a large spoon, then peel, quarter and remove the seeds. Then chop the tomato roughly.
Continue grilling the pepper, chilli and garlic for 4-5 minutes, until the pepper and chilli skins have blackened and the garlic is starting to soften (the garlic skin will start to split when it is ready). When cool enough to handle, peel and halve the chilli, and scrape out and discard the seeds. Peel the pepper and roughly chop both the pepper and chilli.
Spread nuts over the foil and #grill{} until toasted. Finely chop the nuts and @parsley{3 sprigs} in a #blender{}. Tip into a small bowl.
Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a #skillet{}, add the pepper, garlic and chilli and fry for 3 minutes. Tear up the @bread{1 sliced} and add to the pan, turning it in the oil until lightly browned. Pulse in #blender{} with the tomatoes, salt, vinegar and oil until roughly chopped. Tip into a bowl. Leave to cool and store in fridge for up to 3 days.
On the day add the nuts and parsley to the sauce and mix. Serve in a small bowl on a plate with the peeled prawns. Supply cocktail sticks for spearing the prawns.`},

Gather @chinese five spice powder{1/2 teaspoon}, @sesame seed oil{Dash}.
Ask the fishmonger to clean the @squid{400g}; little ones often come ready-cleaned. Using kitchen scissors, cut open the body and open out. Wash well, then pat dry. If you have a large squid, cut the body into four portions, roughly square. Small squid can just be opened up.
Using the tip of a very sharp knife, score the top in a neat criss-cross. Brush with @oil{3  tablespoons} and set aside while you heat the barbecue or griddle until ready to cook.
Mix together 2 tsp sea salt, Chinese five-spice and 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle on both sides of the squid just before cooking, according to taste. You may not need it all. Heat the griddle pan to hot and cook about 1 min each side, until it starts to curl. Remove with tongs to a serving plate and drizzle with a little sesame oil. To serve, garnish with @coriander{Sprigs of fresh} leaves and serve with small bowls of @sweet chilli sauce{Drizzle} to dip into.`},

Gather @mackerel{4}, @red chilli{18 dried}, @pepper{1.5 tsp}, @cumin{1 tsp}, @cinnamon stick{}, @cardamom{2}, @tamarind ball{2 marble sized}.
Soak all the spices, @ginger{1 inch}, @garlic{8 @cloves{4}}, tamarind pulp and kashmiri chilies except @oil{for frying} in @vinegar{2.5 tbsp}. Add @sugar{1 tbsp} and salt. Also add @turmeric{½ tsp} powder.
Combine all nicely and marinate for 35-40 mins. Grind the mixture until soft and smooth. Add more vinegar if required but ensure the paste has to be thick so add vinegar accordingly.
If the masala paste is thin then it would not stick to the fish. Rinse the fish slit from the center and give some incision from the top.
You could see the fish below for clarity. Now stuff the paste into the center and into the incision. Coat the entire fish with this paste.
Marinate the fish for 30 mins. Place oil in a shallow pan, once oil is quite hot shallow fry the stuffed mackerels. Fry until golden brown from both sides Serve the recheado mackerels hot with salad, lime wedges, rice and curry.
Notes 1. Ensure the masala paste is thick else the result won't be good. 2. If you aren't able to find kashmiri chilies then use bedgi chilies or kashmiri red chili powder. 3.
You could use white vinegar or coconut vinegar. 4. Any left over paste could be stored in the fridge for future use. 5. Cinnamon could be avoided as it's a strong spice used generally for meat or chicken.`},

Gather @vermicelli pasta{350g}, @olive oil{5 tblsp}, @onions{1 large}, @baby squid{4}, @fish stock{650ml}.
Boil the kettle. Empty the @mussels{400g} into a colander and run under cold water. Throw away any with broken shells. Pick through the shells, tapping each one on the side of the sink – they should be closed or should slowly close when tapped – if they stay open, throw them away.
If any of the shells still have barnacles or stringy beards attached, pull them off with a cutlery knife and rinse the shells well.
Keep in the colander, covered with a cold, damp cloth, until you’re ready to cook. Peel the prawn shells on the body section only – leave the heads and tails intact.
Score down the backs and pull out any gritty entrails. Chill until you’re ready to cook. Put the @saffron{2 pinches} in a small cup, cover with 50ml kettle-hot water and set aside for 10 mins.
If using vermicelli, put in a bowl and crush to little pieces (about 1cm long) with your hands. Heat the oil in a large #skillet{} with at least a 3cm lip, or a 40cm paella pan.
Add the onion and stir around the pan for 5 mins until soft. Add the @garlic{3 cloves} and cook for 1 min more, then tip in the vermicelli and cook for 5 mins, stirring from time to time, until the vermicelli is toasted brown.
Stir in the @paprika{2 tbs}. Keeping the heat moderate, stir through the @monkfish{1 tail}, squid and saffron with its water, seasoning well.
Spread the ingredients out in an even layer, then pour over the hot stock and scatter the @tomatoes{2 large} on top. Bring to a simmer, then cover the whole dish with a tight-fitting lid (or foil).
Turn the heat to medium and cook for 6 mins. Uncover and stir to incorporate the dry top layer of pasta. Push the mussels into the pasta so the hinges are buried in the bottom of the dish, and they stand straight up.
Arrange the @prawns{8} on top, cover tightly and cook for another 6 mins or until the mussels are open, the prawns are pink and the pasta is cooked through.
Leave to simmer for another 2-3 mins to cook off most of the remaining liquid (leave a little in the pan to prevent the pasta from sticking together).
Allow to sit for 2-3 mins, then squeeze over the @lemon{Juice of 1} juice and arrange the wedges on top. Scatter with @parsley{Topping} before serving.`},

Gather @sesame seed oil{2 tsp}, @seasoned rice vinegar{2 tablespoons}, @vermicelli rice noodles{6 oz}, @egg{2 large}, @ground ginger{2 tblsp}, @jalapeno{1 sliced}, @napa cabbage{1/2}.
For the sweet @onion{1/2}, look for Vidalia, OSO Sweet, or Walla Walla. The super-sweet varieties are more suited to this stir-fry because at the end of cooking, the onion still has a slight crunch.
Make the sauce: In a bowl, combine the sesame oil, @soy sauce{2 tablespoons}, and rice vinegar.
Cook the rice noodles: Bring a large #saucepan{} of water to a boil, add the noodles, and use tongs to turn them so they are submerged. Cook for 2 minutes, or until they are tender but still have some bite (they will cook a little more once you add them to the #skillet{}).
Drain, rinse with cold water, and use scissors to snip the noodles several times to break them up into shorter lengths.
Scramble the eggs: In a small bowl whisk together the eggs. Heat the #skillet{} or Dutch #oven{} over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the peanut or canola oil. Add the eggs and scramble them for 2 minutes, or until they form large, soft curds. Transfer them from the pan to a plate or bowl.
Cook the vegetables: Add 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil to the pan. When it is hot, add the ginger, @garlic{1 clove finely chopped}, @carrots{2}, jalapeño, onion, and @salt{1/2 tsp}. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes or until the vegetables start to soften.
Add the remaining ingredients: Sprinkle the vegetable mixture with the remaining 1 tablespoon peanut or canola oil. When the oil is hot, add the @ham{4 oz}, cabbage, @scallions{4}, @red pepper{1/2}, and @curry powder{2 tsp} to the pan. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
Add the @shrimp{1/2 lb} and cook, stirring, for 3 more minutes or until the shrimp are bright pink and cooked through.
Add the noodles in batches: Add the eggs, the sauce mixture, and half the noodles to the pan. Toss for 1 minute.
Add the remaining noodles and continue tossing for 1 minute more until they are thoroughly combined and the mixture is heated through.
Serve: Taste for seasoning and add more salt or soy sauce, if you like. Sprinkle with @cilantro leaves{2 tablespoons} and serve.`},

To make the dough, rub the @butter{15g} into the flour and then add the @egg{1 Seperated} white and half the yolk (keep the rest), vinegar, a pinch of salt and enough cold water to make a soft dough. Knead on a floured surface until smooth and then wrap and rest for 30 minutes.

Gather @sushi rice{300ml}, @rice wine{100ml}, @caster sugar{2 tbs}, @rice wine{1 tbs}, @soy sauce{1 tbs}.
TO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS: Pat out some rice. Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.
Spread over some Japanese @mayonnaise{3 tbs}. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.
Add the filling. Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings – here we’ve used tuna and @cucumber{1}.
Roll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.
Stick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.
Wrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film.
TO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI: Layer over some smoked salmon. Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.
Cover with rice and press down. Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.
Tip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.
TO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.
Make into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.`},

Gather @carrots{1 medium}, @rice vinegar{1 tablespoon}, @egg roll wrappers{12}, @duck sauce{To serve}, @plum sauce{To serve}.
Alternative Pan Fry Method: If you don’t have access to an air fryer, you can make these egg rolls using a traditional pan fry method. Add enough @oil{For brushing} to a medium #skillet{} with high walls so the oil is about 1/2 inch up the side of the skillet. Heat oil on medium high heat until it reaches 350°F. Add egg rolls and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, flip, and fry for another 3 to 4 minutes until golden brown. Remove and let them drain and cool on a few paper towels.
Cook the filling: In a large #skillet{} over medium heat, add the @olive oil{1 tablespoon} along with the @ground pork{1 lb} or chicken. Break apart the meat with a spatula or wooden spoon as it cooks. Cook until the meat is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add @garlic{1 clove peeled crushed}, @ginger{1 tablespoon}, carrot, @scallions{3 chopped}, and @cabbage{3 Cups}. Continue to cook until cabbage wilts down and is soft, another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring regularly. Season the filling with @@soy sauce{To serve}{1 tablespoon} and rice wine vinegar, and take off the heat to cool. (This filling can be made in advance.)
Assemble the egg rolls: Place a single egg roll wrapper on a dry surface with one point of the square facing you (like a diamond). Place about 1/4 cup of the egg roll filling mixture in the middle of the wrapper.
Dip your fingers in water and run around the edges of the wrapper. Then fold the edges of the wrapper over the center and start rolling the egg roll away from you to form a tight cylinder. Place on a plate and repeat until you are out of filling. You should get at least a dozen egg rolls.
Air fry the egg rolls: Place the egg rolls in the basket of your air fryer. Spray or brush them lightly with oil. Add as many as you can without stacking the egg rolls, making sure they don’t touch. Air needs to circulate around them. Brush the egg rolls lightly with oil.
Place the basket in the air fryer and turn the air fryer to 350°F. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes, then flip the egg rolls, spray or brush with oil a second time on the bottom side, and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes.
Finished egg rolls should be golden brown and crispy! Serve immediately.`},

Gather @red pepper{2}, @tomato{4}.
Preheat your #oven{}'s broiler. Place red bell peppers and tomatoes on a #baking tray{}, and roast under the broiler for about 8 minutes, turning occasionally. This should blacken the skin and help it peel off more easily. Cool, then scrape the skins off of the tomatoes and peppers, and place them in a large bowl. Remove cores and seeds from the bell peppers.
Heat 1 tablespoon of @@@olive oil{6 tablespoons}{4 tablespoons}{1 tablespoon} in a #skillet{} over medium heat. Add the jalapenos and @garlic{4 Cloves Chopped}, and cook until tender, stirring frequently. Remove from heat, and transfer the garlic and @jalapeno{1 chopped} to the bowl with the tomatoes and red peppers. Using two sharp steak knives (one in each hand), cut up the tomatoes and peppers to a coarse and soupy consistency. Stir, and set sauce aside.
Place the @semolina{2 Lbs} in a large bowl, and stir in @@salt{1 1/2 tsp}{To taste} and 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Gradually add @water{3 Cups} while mixing and squeezing with your hand until the dough holds together without being sticky or dry, and molds easily with the hand. Divide into 6 pieces and form into balls.
For each round, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large heavy #skillet{} over medium heat. Roll out dough one round at a time, to no thicker than 1/4 inch. Fry in the hot skillet until dark brown spots appear on the surface, and they are crispy. Remove from the skillet, and wrap in a clean towel while preparing the remaining flat breads.
To eat the bread and sauce, break off pieces of the bread, and scoop them into the sauce. It will slide off, but just keep reaching in!`},

Gather @strong white bread flour{500g}, @caster sugar{70g}, @sunflower oil{70 ml}, @poppy seeds{1 tablespoon}.
Combine the @yeast{10g}, a pinch of the sugar and a couple tablespoons of lukewarm water in a small bowl. Stir to dissolve the yeast, then leave for 10 mins until foamy.
Meanwhile, combine the flour, the remaining sugar and 2 tsp fine salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, then add half the beaten @egg{2 Beaten}, the yeast mixture and the oil. Pour in 200ml lukewarm water (it should feel slightly warm to the touch) and stir with a spoon, then mix using one hand, keeping the other clean while you bring the dough together. If there are a lot of very dry bits, gradually add a little water to just bring it together – you don't want it to get too wet and sticky. The dough should be moist, but not soggy.
Once the dough has come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead using both hands for 10 mins until smooth and a bit springy. If it gets very sticky, add a very small amount of flour – as little as possible. A dough scraper is useful if the dough is sticking to the work surface. Stretch the sides of the dough down and pull together to form a ball. Lightly oil a bowl, then lightly roll the dough ball around the bowl so it's coated in the oil. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave in a warm place for 1 hr, or until dough has doubled in size.
Line a #baking tray{} with baking parchment. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide into three equal pieces, weighing for accuracy, if you like. Roll each piece into a long sausage shape about 25cm long, tapering them slightly at both ends. Lay the pieces out in front of you, parallel to one another with a couple centimetres between each. Bring the sausages together at the top end, then plait them down the length, tucking in the ends when you reach the bottom. Carefully transfer the loaf to the prepared baking sheet and loosely cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to rise until puffy and billowy, about 40 mins.
Meanwhile, heat the #oven{} to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Gently brush the rest of the beaten egg all over the challah, getting it into all the crevices, and sprinkle with the poppy or sesame seeds, if using. Bake on a middle shelf of the oven for 25-30 mins, until the loaf is golden brown underneath and sounds hollow when tapped. Check after about 15 mins – if the top of the loaf has started to get too dark, cover it with foil. Leave to cool on a wire rack, then serve.`},

Pick through your @lentils{1 cup} for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain, and set aside. Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a solid block that you’ll have to break up later In a large #pot{} over medium-high heat, sauté the olive oil and the @onion{1 large} with a pinch of salt for about 3 minutes, then add the @carrots{1 large} and cook for another 3 minutes.
Add the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the @cumin{2 tsp}, @paprika{1 tsp}, @mint{1/2 tsp}, @thyme{1/2 tsp}, @black pepper{1/4 tsp}, and red pepper as quickly as you can and stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices.
Congratulate yourself on how amazing your house now smells. Immediately add the lentils, @water{1 cup}, broth, and salt. Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.
After it has come to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the #pot{} halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.
After the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a #blender{} or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire.
Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary. Serve with crushed-up crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.
You could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.
Makes great leftovers, stays good in the fridge for about a week.`},

Let the dough rest for just 10 minutes then divide the dough into 6-8 balls depending on the size you want for your feteer.
Warm up the butter/ghee or oil you are using and pour into a deep bowl. Immerse the dough balls into the warm butter. Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes.
Preheat #oven{} to 550F. Stretch the first ball with your hands on a clean countertop. Stretch it as thin as you can, the goal here is to see your countertop through the dough.
Fold the dough over itself to form a square brushing in between folds with the butter mixture. Set aside and start making the next ball.
Stretch the second one thin as we have done for the first ball. Place the previous one on the middle seam side down. Fold the outer one over brushing with more butter mixture as you fold.
Set aside. Keep doing this for the third and fourth balls. Now we have one ready, place on a 10 inch baking/pie dish seam side down and brush the top with more butter.
Repeat for the remaining 4 balls to make a second one. With your hands lightly press the folded feteer to spread it on the #baking tray{}.

Gather @all purpose flour{2 cups}.
Instructions   In a large #pot{}, bring @@water{1/2 cup}{8 cups} and @@salt{1 tsp}{1/2 tbs} to a boil to boil the dumplings. In a large #mixing bowl{}, combine the all-purpose flour and salt, stirring to distribute the salt evenly throughout the flour.
Gradually add water to the flour mixture, mixing with your hands until a dough forms. Divide the dough into equal-sized pieces, rolling each into a smooth ball.
Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand to form a round, circular dumpling. It should look like a thick disk.
Carefully drop the dumplings into the boiling water, one at a time, ensuring that they don't stick together. You can use a wooden spoon to stir the dumplings in the water.
Boil the dumplings for 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and have risen to the surface of the water. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Use a slotted spoon to remove the cooked dumplings from the #pot{}, allowing any excess water to drain. Serve with your favorite recipes.`},

Gather @heavy cream{1/4 cup}, @all purpose flour{1 1/2 cups}, @granulated sugar{3/4 cup}, @heavy cream{1 tablespoon}.
Boil the @potatoes{3 Lbs}. Peel the potatoes while still warm and run them through a potato ricer twice. ▢ Let the potatoes cool in an uncovered bowl in the fridge. ▢ Stir the @salt{1 teaspoon}, @sugar{1 teaspoon}, @melted @butter{14 tablespoons}{1/4 cup}, and cream into the riced potatoes. ▢ Slowly add the @flour{1/2 cup} and knead by hand until you get a good consistency.
Don't add more flour than necessary! Roll the dough into a long sausage and divide into about 7 or 8 pieces if using an 18 inch griddle.
If using a smaller griddle or #skillet{}, divide the dough into 10 – 12 pieces. ▢ Roll each piece into a ball and then press into a flat circle, using the edges of your hands to form the dough into a nice circle shape without any cracks.
This is important, otherwise you won't get round lefser. ▢ Heat up your griddle on medium/high heat. ▢ Flour your rolling surface and roll the lefse dough into a large circle slightly smaller than your griddle or #skillet{}.
Begin rolling with a smooth rolling pin, then switch to a corrugated rolling pin as the lefse gets thinner. Don't use too much flour, as then the edges can become hard. ▢ Roll the lefse onto your lefse stick and then gently unroll it onto your griddle.
After a minute or two check the underside of the lefse for brown spots and then use the lefse stick to flip the lefse and cook on the other side. ▢ Use the lefse stick to remove the lefse from the griddle and place it in a folded damp sheet or tablecloth.`},

Preheat #oven{} to 410° F. Pour the @water{2 1/2 cups} into a large bowl. Make sure it is room temperature. Add the @salt{1 tsp}. Blend well with a mixer, fork or spatula to make sure it dissolves well. While you continue to beat the mixture, slowly add the corn meal—a little bit at a time. Once all the flour is added, keep mixing until the corn meal, water and salt are thoroughly blended and dissolved. Set aside the masa in its bowl. Let it rest for 5 minutes so that the flour is thoroughly hydrated. This type of corn flour does not have any gluten, so it doesn’t need to be kneaded. The masa should be smooth, firm yet malleable. While waiting for the 5 minutes’ rest, heat your budare (or comal, griddle, cast-iron pan or non-stick pan) over medium heat. Coat with a little bit of the oil. Fill a small bowl with water to wet your hands to make the arepas. Take about 2 Tbsp of the masa in your damp hands. The masa should fit easily in your palm so that it is easy to shape into a small ball.
Cross your hands, so that one is on top of the other, with the masa ball between them. Rotate your right hand in a circle, so that you are at the same time both pressing the masa into a flat disc and keeping its round shape. arepa making The last step in shaping your arepa is to quickly pass and lightly press the masa disc from one hand to the other until it is about ¾ of an inch thick and 4 inches wide. Smooth the edges with your fingertips (quickly dip them into the water bowl first) so that they stay as round as possible and without cracks. arepa making Place your arepas in batches on the preheated surface of your budare griddle or nonstick pan. Let each side turn golden, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Check them often so that they don’t burn. Once they are nicely browned on both sides, place the arepas on a #baking tray{} in your preheated #oven{} for 10 minutes. They should be somewhat puffy, so that if you tap an arepa lightly on top, it will sound like you are tapping an empty box. Serve arepas hot, whether you stuff with them with your choice of fillings or serve solo to accompany your favorite Venezuelan guiso or stew.`},

Tip the contents of the pan into a colander over a bowl to catch the clam stock. When cool enough to handle, remove the clams from their shells – reserving a handful of empty shells for presentation if you want.
Strain the clam stock into a jug, leaving any grit in the bottom of the bowl. You should have around 800ml stock. Heat the @butter{50g} in the same pan and sizzle the @bacon{150g} for 3-4 mins until it starts to brown.
Stir in the @onion{1 finely chopped}, @thyme{sprigs of fresh} and bay and cook everything gently for 10 mins until the onion is soft and golden. Scatter over the flour and stir in to make a sandy paste, cook for 2 mins more, then gradually stir in the clam stock then the @milk{150ml} and the cream.
Throw in the @potatoes{2 medium}, bring everything to a simmer and leave to bubble away gently for 10 mins or until the potatoes are cooked.
Use a fork to crush a few of the potato chunks against the side of the pan to help thicken – you still want lots of defined chunks though.

Gather @green chilli{1}, @red chilli powder{¼ teaspoon}.
Rinse the baingan (eggplant or @aubergine{1 large}) in water. Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Apply some @oil{1.5 tablespoon} all over and keep it for roasting on an open flame.
You can also #grill{} the baingan or roast in the #oven{}. But then you won't get the smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly cooked.
You could also embed some @garlic{6 cloves} cloves in the baingan and then roast it. 2. Roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender.
With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid easily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools down. 3.
You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is an optional step. Use natural charcoal for this method.
Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red. 4. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife.
Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal.
The charcoal would begin to smoke. 5. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl.
Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta will become.
I just keep for a minute. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is cooked, just like the way we do for Dal Tadka. 6.
Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant. 7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it. 8. In a kadai or pan, heat oil.
Then add finely chopped onions and garlic. 9. Saute the onions till translucent. Don't brown them. 10. Add chopped green chilies and saute for a minute. 11.
Add the chopped @tomatoes{1 cup} and mix it well. 12. Bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts separating from the mixture. 13.
Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix well. 14. Add the chopped cooked baingan. 15. Stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the @onion{½ cup}­tomato masala mixture. 16.
Season with @salt{as required}. Stir and saute for some more 4 to 5 minutes more. 17. Finally stir in the @coriander leaves{1 tablespoon chopped} with the baingan bharta or garnish it with them.
Serve Baingan Bharta with phulkas, rotis or chapatis. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.`},

Gather @red cabbage{450g}, @onion{1 small}, @caraway seed{2 tsp}, @sea salt{1 tsp}.
Tip all the ingredients into a large bowl, add 1-1½ tsp freshly ground black pepper, then scrunch it all together with your hands for 5 mins. You might want to wear gloves to avoid staining your skin with the @beetroot{320g} juices.
Press the veg down in the bowl with your hands, then cover the surface and up the side of the bowl with a large sheet of compostable cling film or something reusable like a beeswax wrap. Now place another similar-sized bowl on top. Press down hard and add anything heavy (packs of rice or cans work well) to weigh it down so the juices rise to cover the surface. Cover again.
Leave to ferment at room temperature for at least five days, but for maximum flavour, leave for one-five weeks (until the bubbling subsides).
Check the sauerkraut. After a few days, you will see bubbles that have built up as it ferments. Give it a stir, then cover and weigh it down again as before. The cabbage will become increasingly sour the longer it’s fermented, so taste it now and again. When you like the flavour, transfer it to sterilised jars and keep chilled. Will keep chilled for up to six months.`},

Gather @broad beans{2 cups}, @garlic clove{4}.
As the cooking time varies depending on the quality and age of the beans, it is good to cook them in advance and to reheat them when you are ready to serve.
Cook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large #saucepan{} with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened.
They take 2–2 1/2 hours of gentle simmering. When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce. It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans.
This is to thicken the sauce. Serve the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped @parsley{1/3 cup} and accompanied by Arab bread.
Pass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin @olive oil{Dash}, the quartered @lemons{3}, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili-pepper flakes, and one with ground @cumin{Sprinking}.
The beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing. Optional Garnishes Peel hard-boiled eggs—1 per person—to cut up in the bowl with the beans.
Top the beans with a chopped cucumber-and-tomato salad and thinly sliced mild onions or scallions. Otherwise, pass round a good bunch of scallions and quartered tomatoes and cucumbers cut into sticks.
Serve with tahina cream sauce (page 65) or salad (page 67), with pickles and sliced onions soaked in vinegar for 30 minutes.
Another way of serving ful medames is smothered in a garlicky tomato sauce (see page 464). In Syria and Lebanon, they eat ful medames with yogurt or feta cheese, olives, and small cucumbers.
Variations A traditional way of thickening the sauce is to throw a handful of red lentils (1/4 cup) into the water at the start of the cooking.
In Iraq, large brown beans are used instead of the small Egyptian ones, in a dish called badkila, which is also sold for breakfast in the street.`},

Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain. Cover the @chickpeas{Can} and warm in the microwave briefly before serving.

Gather @brown lentils{12 ounces (340g)}, @apple cider vinegar{2 teaspoons (10ml)}, @egg plants{2 large}.
For the Lentils: Adjust #oven{} rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F to prepare for roasting eggplant. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons @olive oil{2 tablespoons} in a medium #saucepan{} over medium heat until shimmering. Add @carrots{2 small cut into chunks}, @celery{2 small stalks}, and @onion{1 medium finely diced} and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add @garlic{6 medium cloves sliced} and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lentils, @bay leaves{2}, stock or @water{4 cups}, and a pinch of @salt{Pinch}. Bring to a simmer, cover with the lid partially ajar, and cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. (Top up with water if lentils are at any point not fully submerged.) Remove lid, stir in vinegar, and reduce until lentils are moist but not soupy. Season to taste with salt and @pepper{Pinch}, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve.
2. For the Eggplant: While lentils cook, cut each eggplant in half. Score flesh with the tip of a paring knife in a cross-hatch pattern at 1-inch intervals. Transfer to a foil-lined rimmed #baking tray{}, cut side up, and brush each eggplant half with 1 tablespoon oil, letting each brushstroke be fully absorbed before brushing with more. Season with salt and pepper. Place a @rosemary{4 sprigs} sprig on top of each one. Transfer to #oven{} and roast until completely tender and well charred, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and discard rosemary.
3. To Serve: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and @pine nuts{1/4 cup} in a medium #skillet{} set over medium heat. Cook, tossing nuts frequently, until golden brown and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to halt cooking. Stir half of @parsley{2 tablespoons} and rosemary into lentils and transfer to a serving platter. Arrange eggplant halves on top. Spread a few tablespoons of tahini sauce over each eggplant half and sprinkle with pine nuts. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and rosemary, drizzle with additional olive oil, and serve.`},

Gather @sunflower oil{1 tablespoon}, @hispi (sweetheart) cabbage{150g}, @egg{1 large}, @vegetable oil{1/2 tbs}, @plain flour{350g}, @vegetable oil{For frying}, @plain flour{Dusting}, @sour cream{60 ml}.
First, make the crispy @@shallots{2}{2}. Heat the oil in a #saucepan{} to 180C (a cube of bread will turn golden in 15 secs). Toss the shallots in a little flour and deep-fry for 1 min or until light golden and crispy. Drain on kitchen paper. Can be made up to two days before and kept in an airtight container.
To make the filling, heat the oil in a medium non-stick #skillet{} and gently fry the shallots for 10 mins until starting to turn golden.
Add the @sauerkraut{150g} and cabbage, and cook for 5-10 mins until the cabbage has softened. Taste and add a little salt if under-seasoned, or sugar if stringent. Scrape into a bowl and leave to cool completely.
To make the dough, mix the eggs and oil with 125ml water, then gradually add in the flour, mixing well with your hands. Knead it on a well-floured surface until the dough stops sticking to your hands. You should end up with firm, elastic dough. Wrap it in cling film and rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins, or overnight.
Flour your work surface generously. Roll out the dough to a 40cm circle or until the dough is as thick as £1 coin.
Using a 9cm cookie cutter, cut out discs in the dough – you should end up with about 25 discs. Do not throw away the off-cuts – we throw them in with the pierogi when boiling to minimise any waste.
Have a well-floured tray ready. Put 1 tsp of the filling into the centre of each disc. In your hand, fold in half around the filling and seal to create half-moon shapes. Put them on the floured tray, making sure they don’t touch each other.
Bring a large #saucepan{} of salted water to the boil and carefully lower the pierogi in. Boil them for 2 mins or until they float to the top.
Drain and serve with a knob of @butter{45g} and some soured cream. Finish by sprinkling the crispy shallots on top to serve.`},

Gather @egg plants{1.5 pounds sliced}, @peanut oil{2 tablespoons}, @chilli bean paste{1 ½ tbsp}, @sichuan pepper{2 tsp}, @apple cider vinegar{2 tsp}.
This recipe calls for asian eggplants, or Japanese eggplants. They are long and thin compared to a European or globe eggplant, and much more tender and delicate. If you can't find them you can substitute globe eggplant, but the dish is really best with the asian eggplant.
*A lot of grocery stores have Asian ingredient aisles now. You should be able to find chili-bean paste, a mixture of preserved chilies mixed with mashed soybeans, there or at any Asian market. (Do not confuse with black bean paste or chili-@garlic{5 cloves} paste.)
**Sichuan peppercorns are available at some stores and online for quite cheap. They aren't spicy like other peppers but rather have a citrusy flavor and induce a tingly, numbing sensation like a carbonated drink.
Prep eggplant, chili sauce, @cornstarch{1 tsp} slurry, vinegar and @scallions{4 Chopped}: Begin your mise en place. Quarter the eggplant lengthwise and chop into large batons and set aside.
In a small bowl, mix together the @chicken stock{1/4 cup}, @sugar{2 tsp}, and @soy sauce{1/2 tsp} and set it aside.
In a second bowl, mix together the chili bean paste, garlic, @ginger{2 tsp}, and sichuan peppercorns and set it aside.
In a third bowl, mix together the cornstarch with a tablespoon of water and set it aside.
Lastly, in a fourth bowl, mix together the scallions and vinegar and set it aside.
Sauté eggplant: Place the oil in a #wok{} or large sauté pan over medium-high heat until the oil is almost smoking. Add the eggplant and sauté, allowing it to sit for a few seconds each time you move it to allow it to brown and blister. If the eggplant absorbs all the oil and some pieces don't get any then add a little more oil.
Add the chili bean paste, garlic, ginger, and sichuan peppercorns and sauté: until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the chicken stock mixture: turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for 90 seconds.
Add the cornstarch mixture: and stir together until the sauce thickens a bit.
Add the scallions and vinegar: and cook for 15 seconds to diffuse their harsh flavors a bit.
Garnish with @cilantro{Garnish} and serve.`},

Gather @olive oil{1 tbls}, @onion{1}, @leek{1 chopped}, @smoked paprika{1 tsp}, @chili powder{1 tsp}, @dried oregano{1/2 tsp}, @diced tomatoes{1 can}, @brown lentils{1 1/2 cups}.
Begin by roasting the @squash{1 Small}. Slice it into thin crescents and drizzle with a little oil and sprinkle with @sea salt{1 tsp}. I added a fresh little sage I had in the fridge, but it’s unnecessary. Roast the squash a 205 C (400 F) for 20-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until soft and golden. Let cool and chop into cubes. Meanwhile, rinse the lentils and cover them with @water{3 cups}. Bring them to the boil then turn down to a simmer and let cook (uncovered) for 20-30 minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside. While the lentils are cooking heat the 1 Tbsp. of oil on low in a medium #pot{}. Add the onions and leeks and sauté for 5 or so minutes, or until they begin to soften. Add the @garlic{3 cloves} next along with the @cumin{4 tsp ground} and @coriander{2 tsp ground}, cooking for a few more minutes. Add the remaining spices – paprika, @cinnamon{1/2 tsp}, chilli, @cocoa{1 tsp}, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and oregano. Next add the can of tomatoes, the water or stock, and @carrots{3 chopped}. Let simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until the veg is tender and the mixture has thickened up. You’ll need to check on the pot periodically for a stir and a top of of liquid if needed. Add the lentils and chopped roasted squash. Let cook for 10 more minutes to heat through. Serve with sliced jalapeno, lime wedges, cilantro, green onions, and cashew sour cream.
SIMPLE CASHEW SOUR CREAM
1 Cup Raw Unsalted @cashews{1 Cup} Pinch Sea Salt 1 tsp. @apple cider vinegar{1 tsp} Water
Bring some water to the boil, and use it to soak the cashews for at least four hours. Alternatively, you can use cold water and let the cashews soak overnight, but I’m forgetful/lazy, so often use the boil method which is much faster. After the cashews have soaked, drain them and add to a high speed #blender{}. Begin to puree, slowly adding about 1/2 cup fresh water, until a creamy consistency is reached. You may need to add less or more water to reach the desired consistency. Add a pinch of sea salt and vinegar (or lemon juice).`},

Put a large non-stick #skillet{} on a low heat. Cook the @onion{1 sliced} slowly in the oil and @butter{25g} until soft but not brown – this should take about 15 mins.

Gather @olive oil{1 tbs}, @garlic clove{Minced}, @allspice{To taste}.
Before you do anything, freeze your @bacon{2 strips} slices that way when you're ready to prep, it'll be so much easier to chop! Wash the @potatoes{3 Medium} and cut medium dice into square pieces.
To prevent any browning, place the already cut potatoes in a bowl filled with water. In the meantime, heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a large #skillet{} over medium-high heat.
Tilt the #skillet{} so the oil spreads evenly. Once the oil is hot, drain the potatoes and add to the skillet. Season with @salt{Pinch}, @pepper{Pinch}, and Old Bay as needed.
Cook for 10 minutes, stirring the potatoes often, until brown. If needed, add a tablespoon more of oil. Chop up the bacon and add to the potatoes.
The bacon will start to render and the fat will begin to further cook the potatoes. Toss it up a bit! The bacon will take 5-6 minutes to crisp.
Once the bacon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the minced garlic and toss. Season once more. Add dried or fresh @parsley{Garnish}.
Control heat as needed. Let the garlic cook until fragrant, about one minute. Just before serving, drizzle over the @maple syrup{1 tbs} and toss.
Let that cook another minute, giving the potatoes a caramelized effect. Serve in a warm bowl with a sunny side up egg!`},

Heat the flat #grill{} plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.
Cook the @sausages{2} first. Add the sausages to the hot #grill{} plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden.
After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the #oven{}.
Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the @bacon{3}. Place the bacon straight on to the #grill{} plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached.
Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the #oven{}. For the @mushrooms{2}, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top.
Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the #grill{} plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes.
Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy. For the @tomatoes{2}, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'.
Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the #grill{} plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes.
Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape. For the @black pudding{1 Slice}, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin.
Place on the #grill{} plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy. For 'proper' fried @bread{1 Slice} it's best to cook it in a separate pan.
Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a #skillet{} to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden.
If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice. For the fried @eggs{2}, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds.
Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.
Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.`},

Gather @vanilla extract{1 teaspoon}, @strawberries{}, @raspberries{}, @blackberries{}.
Preheat #oven{} to 400ºF (200ºC), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a bowl, mix @cream cheese{1 1/4 oz}, @sugar{1 1/4 cup}, and vanilla until fully combined.
Lightly @flour{} the surface and roll out @puff pastry{2} on top to flatten. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares.
On the top right and bottom left of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ½ inch (1 cm) from the edge. NOTE: This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both L shapes should not meet at the ends.
Your pastry should look like a picture frame with two corners still intact. Take the upper right corner and fold down towards the inner bottom corner.
You will now have a diamond shape. Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries on top.
Repeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the parchment covered #baking tray{}. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffed.

Gather @self-raising flour{750g}, @eggs{2}.
This is one recipe a lot of people have requested and I have tried to make it as simple as possible and I hope it will work for you. Make sure you use the right flour which is basically one with raising agents. Adjust the amount of @sugar{6 tablespoons} to your taste and try using different flavours to have variety whenever you have them. You can use Coconut @milk{1 cup} instead of regular milk, you can also add desiccated coconut to the dry flour or other spices like powdered cloves or cinnamon. For “healthy looking” mandazis do not roll the dough too thin before frying and use the procedure I have indicated above.
1. Mix the flour,cinnamon and sugar in a suitable bowl. 2. In a separate bowl whisk the egg into the milk 3. Make a well at the centre of the flour and add the milk and egg mixture and slowly mix to form a dough. 4. Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes or until it stops sticking to the sides of the bowl and you have a smooth surface. 5. Cover the dough with a damp cloth  and allow to rest for 15 minutes. 6. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1cm thick piece. 7. Using a sharp small knife, cut the dough into the desired size setting aside ready for deep frying. 8. Heat your oil in a suitable #pot{} and gently dip the mandazi pieces to cook until light brown on the first side then turn to cook on the second side. 9. Serve them warm or cold`},
